One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.  Map and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small submap of the French strongpoint &amp;quot;Isabelle&amp;quot; further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the submap &amp;quot;Isabelle&amp;quot;). Each sector has several zones that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feel.  Three Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered ... anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.  French supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though the air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food &amp;amp; bullets, fuel &amp;amp; spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.  Viet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.  Artillery: Artillery is another important aspect of the battle. There is bombardment from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Viet Minh artillery is off-board and safe from French artillery fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountainsides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh bombardment. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are obviously out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition and therefore have to spend it wisely.  Combat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die-rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender&amp;rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend. The defender&amp;rsquo;s second die-roll (modified from the result of the first die roll), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The first one to see how well the assault is conducted, and the second one to see the outcome of the assault. Modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit to make it stronger or weaker.  You will never know for sure what that result will be due to the two die-rolls on each side. Dien Bien Phu &amp;ndash; The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of this war as well as shaping the events of things to come.

The only large land mass still held by the Allies was Australia, which they desperately needed as a staging area for a planned U.S. led counter-attack. The Japanese knew of the importance of Australia, but lacked the resources to conquer it, so they decided on the next best thing: Isolate Australia from the United States by building an airfield on the island of Guadalcanal, from which planes could disrupt the Allied supply lines.  The United States, ill-prepared as it was for any offensive actions, immediately attacked with the 1st Marine Division under the command of Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, caught the Japanese by surprise and easily took control of the airfield. The Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Lt. Gen. Harukichi Hyakutake, counterattacked with an ever-increasing number of troops. For the next four months a titanic struggle took place in the air, on land and on sea as the isolated Marines and U.S. Army fought for their lives to hold their tiny perimeter around the airfield against the might of the Japanese Empire.  Conflict of Heroes: Guadalcanal &amp;ndash; Pacific Ocean 1942 recreates this struggle on your tabletop and includes gorgeous beach and jungles maps of the South Pacific, amphibious landing craft, the USMC, Japanese Banzai Charges, night combat, and much more.","/boardgame/68076/conflict-heroes-guadalcanal-pacific-1942"

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.  The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.  The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.  The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.  The player with the most victory points wins.  The rules include basic and advanced versions.  This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.","/boardgame/84876/castles-burgundy"

The Korean War stands as a key event in world history. The first shooting confrontation of the Cold War, and the first limited war of the nuclear age, it is the only time since the Second World War that two of the world's major military powers fought one another - in this case the United States and China.  Diplomatically, the war offers an interesting view of the miscalculation and ineptitude on both sides that led to open conflict. It also brings to light the United Nations' first opportunity to play a leading role in world military events.  Korea: The Forgotten War covers the first year of the war and highlights the mobile phases of the battle. Campaign victory is determined most often by the stable positions of the lines (relative to the &amp;quot;neck&amp;quot; of the peninsula). A number of shorter scenarios are also included to allow players to explore specific operations or to use as a training scenario before taking on one of the campaign games.  Korea: The Forgotten War was initially released in 2003. The 2014 (2nd edition) is a reprint of the 2003 (1st edition) with changes made to address errata and to better conform to the latest version of the OCS rules when printed.   Korea: The Forgotten War has 15 scenarios broken down as follows:     5 1-map scenarios     4 2-map scenarios     6 3-map scenarios  Game Scale: Turn: Half-week Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km Units: Battalion to Army  2014 Game Inventory: Three 22 x 34&amp;quot; full-color mapsheets Four dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 2 markers - 560 1/2&amp;quot; counters) One 48-page OCS v4.1a rules booklet One 40-page Korea v2.0 game specific rules booklet Two 4-page OCS v4.1a Charts &amp;amp; Tables Folders Two dual-sided Player Aid cards Two 6-sided dice  Complexity: High Solitaire Suitability: High Playing Time: 4-100 hours Players: 1 or more","/boardgame/6581/korea-forgotten-war"

One historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people polarized and separated by superpower politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their arbitrary division once and for all.  From Pyongyang in North Korea to Busan in the South, the war rages. In a scene reminiscent of the first attack by the In Min Gun in 1950, the North Korean People&amp;rsquo;s Army surges across the Demilitarized Zone and penetrates deep into South Korea.  Special Operations Forces from both sides conduct raids, interdiction, and reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines while airborne, air assault, and amphibious forces strike far behind those lines attempting to outflank the main army forces of both sides. In the air, both sides wage a heated campaign in an effort to establish superiority over the skies of Korea. With rough terrain and the full ferocity of modern armor, airmobile, airborne, and marine warfighting capabilities, there is no safe haven in the lethal cauldron of battle which has engulfed the Korean Peninsula.  While North and South battle for a quick, decisive victory, the world awaits the response of the two military superpowers in the region: the United States of America and the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. Will the United States, stung by high casualties among the soldiers of its 2nd Infantry Division near the DMZ during the surprise artillery barrages and initial assaults on the first day of the war, be able to reinforce the South quickly enough, and, if so, how and in what strength? Will the Communist Chinese again react (or pre-emptively intervene) to a massive US response and join the fray, thus widening the conflict? As the situation evolves, choices are made, forces are committed, and the security of Japan and the future of the two Koreas hangs in the balance.  Next War: Korea, the first of a planned series of Next War games, allows players to fight a near future war on the Korean peninsula. In this updated and improved version of the previously-released Crisis: Korea 1995, players have access to virtually all military assets of North and South Korea, as well as large forces from the USA and the PRC. The integrated, easy to learn air-land combat system allows for unit efficiency, armor effects, light infantry, attack helicopters, Close Air Support, Cruise Missiles, and the particularly tough terrain of Korea.  Make no mistake: Next War: Korea is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &amp;quot;easy to learn&amp;quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &amp;quot;mini-monster game&amp;quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &amp;quot;deliver.&amp;quot;  So our hope is that we have created a game with enough variety and scaling of complexity that you can find an engaging and maybe even enlightening experience whether you want to play a fast two-player game, a longer monster game, or an ongoing solitaire study. We intend to provide tools for online game play as well (a Vassal module is being created now for use during playtesting) so that this game can be played in either real-time or over longer periods on the internet.  				 				 					Units  Ground units in Next War: Korea represent primarily divisions and brigades of armies of North and South Korea, The United States and her Allies, and the People's Republic of China. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.  Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.  Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &amp;quot;Sea Control&amp;quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side.  				 				 					Maps and Terrain  The game's two maps present a portion of modern-day Korea at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The maps cover the entire peninsula east-to-west and stretch from about 30 miles north of Pyongyang in the North to Taegu in the south. Hexes are larger than the standard 1/2&amp;quot; hex found in Crisis Korea: 1995, allowing us to use larger 9/16&amp;quot; counters in this game and make it a bit easier for players to move game pieces in the congested areas around the DMZ.  				 				 					Game System  As in Crisis: Korea 1995, there are two types of game turns: Initiative turns (longer turns where the side with the Initiative has more opportunities to move and attack) and Contested turns (shorter turns where neither side has the initiative but each is trying to muster the resources to regain the initiative). Thus the inherent &amp;quot;initiative player advantage&amp;quot; built into the game system incents each player to always be thinking about how to seize and maintain the battlefield initiative.  A Standard game turn is composed of:      Weather Determination. Bad weather can severaly hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.     Initiative Determination     an Air/Naval Phase, wherein air superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.      One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements     Victory Determination     Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody, reflecting both what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early on in light of the massive artillery concentrations near the DMZ as well as the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses, but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapidity and pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.  				 				 					Scenarios  There are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three one mappers, &amp;quot;Seoul Train,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Uijong Blues,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;East Coast Highway&amp;quot; (North Map only) cover the first week of the war by dividing the DMZ into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults to break the South Korean lines and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &amp;quot;big game.&amp;quot; Players can also play the entire DMZ front scenario, &amp;quot;Militarized Zone,&amp;quot; (North Map only) for the first week (basically, combining the three scenarios above). In addition, players can add the South Map and play the entire Standard Campaign game, &amp;quot;All In.&amp;quot; Two other scenarios are provided which examine the U.S. Amphibious landing. &amp;quot;Inchon Again&amp;quot; and the battle for Taejon, &amp;quot;Spearhead.&amp;quot; In addition, a scenario, &amp;quot;They Did What?&amp;quot; is provided for players to experiement with a South Korean attack on North Korea without, however, the help of the United States.  The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &amp;agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &amp;quot;At Start&amp;quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.  There is also an International Posture Matrix &amp;agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Korean players in the region.  In Next War: Korea, the Korean Peninsula is on fire with two of the world's most well-prepared, antagonistic forces arrayed against each other. Can you, as the North Korean People&amp;rsquo;s Army commander, conquer the South in 3 weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of Korea&amp;rsquo;s Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will China do? There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out...

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.  While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.","/boardgame/91/paths-glory"

In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.  Case Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.  A range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an &amp;quot;If I Was in Charge...&amp;quot; version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.  A simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:  &amp;bull; The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).  &amp;bull; The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).  &amp;bull; The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).  &amp;bull; The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.  The game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause &amp;mdash; an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash &amp;mdash; and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.  The Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!  Scenarios  1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.    2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.    3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.    4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.    5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.    6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn.

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &amp;quot;Don't Panic!&amp;quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).  As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &amp;quot;good old days&amp;quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.  The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player (in contrast with maps from games like The Gamers' &amp;quot;Thunder at the Crossroads&amp;quot;, where the vibrant color can make you cross-eyed). Hues of gray and green predominate. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.  The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.  In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.  Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail. The Killing Ground includes five scenarios, all historical.  Game Scale Units: Primarily regimental with tank and other support units as battalions. Time: Each game-turn is 1 day. Map: 2.5km per hex.

The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp. Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp. Can the Americans stop them?  Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse. The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces. Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a &amp;quot;bulge&amp;quot; in the American line.  Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse. Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th. Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack. The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43.  The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the &amp;quot;Bulge enthusiast&amp;quot; and the casual player will enjoy. German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself). The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt. Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River.

The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).  It is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 &amp;quot;3&amp;quot; cards count as kings and all four &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.  In every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:     * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.     * Peque&amp;ntilde;a or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.     * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.     * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque. At last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.  One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.","/boardgame/6866/mus"

The game components feature a beautiful map from Mark Mahaffey, stretching from Leningrad in the north to the Caucasus Mountains in the south, and around 600 counters representing every major unit that appeared during the course of the conflict. Initially most Soviet infantry are divisions, but as the game progresses these are replaced by armies and corps, so that players are not overwhelmed by the increasing Soviet Order of Battle.  All German mechanized divisions are present in the game, while their infantry is a mix of division and corps.  Although the game is a semi-monster, and covers the entirety of the conflict from the launch of Barbarossa to the end of the war, the game system emphasizes playability rather than rules overhead, allowing the players to concentrate on strategy choices rather than rules minutiae.  The core of the game system is a ""chit-pull"" activation system. Each turn a variety of action chits are drawn, in a random order, from the Action Chit Pool, and it is this that determines the exact flow of operations on that turn. [...]  This chit-pull system imposes constant uncertainty upon the player and introduces considerable tension into the game. [...]  The Axis supply network, which imposed crucial restraints upon the effectiveness of the offensive, is represented using supply depot units.[...]  Besides the full campaign game, TDV features scenarios for Barbarossa, Case Blue, Kursk, and the Destruction of Army Group Center. Scenario start dates can also be used to explore shorter versions of the campaign.  The Dark Valley is designed to be playable and exciting, modeling the tension of the campaign elegantly and simply.

After the ruthless Terran&amp;ndash;Hegemony War (30.027&amp;ndash;33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable &amp;ndash; only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule?  A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals. You will explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships with which to wage war. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.

The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.  The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.  The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.  Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.","/boardgame/83325/lost-battles-forty-battles-campaigns-ancient-world"

They filled the caverns with bodies and locked them away from the upper air.  Eventually the dead forgot the living--if any remain.  But in death, a new life began.   The breath of evil from the darkness of complete shadow stirred corrupted flesh.  In their middens and pits, the dead awakened, swarming through slime-fluxing tunnels, seeking chthonic power, warring with demons and denizens of the deep. Animated by the black flame, necro-ecologies rose and collapsed in the crypt-universe.  Now, cloistered undead lich-wizards have discovered the primordial opening to the shadow source, the doleful horror-hole where the Eternal Evil Emperor watches and waits....  The necromancers have dug their Lairs deep into the ground.  They must gather precious resources and body parts to assemble an army of minions, while defending their own lairs from the excavations and intrusions of others. In the end, the only route is into the demon path...  Then depletion of your essence leads to spending another eternity in foul sepulchral darkness awaiting the next Awakening of Death.&amp;quot;  Each player takes the role of an ancient Necromancer.  Located deep within an earth, their Necropolises have now merged, each seeking the Darkest Pit, the location of all evil.  The dark wizards must build minions with precious resources from their Lairs to send forth and destroy, or dig further tunnels to locate other creatures, resources or to ambush another sorcerer.  The game is won when only one remaining Necromancer stands. A Necromancer can either be destroyed by combat, or an enemy minion may venture into their Lair and crush the wizard's shadow power, a Chthonic Crystal. BUT an even greater darkness may befall the players.  As they build and destroy creatures the Dark Pit absorbs the shadowflame and may awaken the ultimate Cave Evil.","/boardgame/84889/cave-evil"

Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &amp;quot;Hitlerjugend&amp;quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&amp;mdash;elite panzergrenadier units.  The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning.  The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&amp;auml;rvi  from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939.  Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem.  There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!  Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns.  Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages.  The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup.  The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&amp;mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&amp;mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively. Some of the shorter scenarios feature the Germans on the offensive to recapture lost ground.  The game was designed for two players, but works very well solitaire.

Hornet Leader spans all aspects of US naval aviation throughout the service life of the F/A-18 Hornet from 1983 to the present day.  The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Navy strike aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.  A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?

One player assumes the role of the British (including Canadian) forces, and the other plays the Americans. This often-overlooked conflict ended in a draw historically, but this was not the only possible outcome. The Americans clearly wished to annex Canada to their young nation, while the British wanted to teach their former colonies a lesson. The game includes all of the theaters of battle from the war: the US/ Canadian border and the Great Lakes (of course) but also the wilderness of the old Northwest, the Atlantic coast of the US, the Civilized Indians of the south, and the site of the final conflict at New Orleans.  Each turn represents a few months of time (depending on the season). A typical turn consists of dealing out to each player the number of cards indicated on the turn track. The winter and spring turns require a few special tasks. The Americans will have more resources to commit to the war- until Napoleon is defeated in Europe, and the English player can focus more resources on their efforts in North America. Each card can be played for the event described on the card, or for the card&amp;rsquo;s Operations Points, to move Expeditions, build ships and fortifications, or raise troops.  Events on the cards and on the map will cause the markers on the Peace Track to move forward.  This represents the war weariness of each side&amp;rsquo;s people: bad events will cause your people to demand peace.  Most events push inexorably towards peace; only a few rally your people for a longer war. When the two markers meet on the Peace Track, the game proceeds to the negotiations at Ghent, and the winner is determined.  Oh yes, and then each player plays one more card, while news of the peace travels across the Atlantic!","/boardgame/92363/amateurs-arms"

Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and most importantly Fame.  The most adaptive, risk taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!  Customize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.  Adapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!  Sandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play, players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!

During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large &amp;quot;packages&amp;quot; of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.  Covering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.  Packages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and &amp;quot;Iron Hand&amp;quot; aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.  The North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi. The Vietnamese player must disrupt enemy attacks.  20 scenarios cover historical strike raids from the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker operations.

This edition combines both the original game and its two extensions (Na Berlin! and No Surrender!) using deluxe components of ""Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition"" quality. With only 40 Army/Front sized counters for the Tournament game, and 70 for the whole campaign, and with very low stacking, it&amp;rsquo;s a quick-playing yet realistic affair that favours the strategic and offensive-minded player.  Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.  In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat: The Russian Front  stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&amp;rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.  Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: ""No Retreat!""

Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.  Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &amp;mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.  And that&amp;rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&amp;rsquo;ve ever played before.  Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &amp;quot;starter lists&amp;quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes.  Additional factions lists are now available in the &amp;quot;Uncharted Empires&amp;quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).","/boardgame/85204/kings-war"

The game focuses on the intensive years from 1950 - 1954 in  the northern part of Vietnam, called Tonkin, and Laos. It is a game of high interactive play where both players have a set of ten operation points and a number of supply dumps.  By spending operations points you will be able to perform different, mostly non-combat, actions. By expending a supply dump you will also be allowed to perform combat missions. But there will be a limited number of supply dumps to expend and they will also be needed to keep units in supply. When you spend operation points you will only be allowed to spend one, two or three points in a row before it is your opponents turn to spend his.  This creates a game where you, in the long term, will have to plan and save supply and at the same time be prepared to react to your opponent's actions.

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.  The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.  Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).  Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.

Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.  7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.  In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.

In BattleCON, players choose characters with unique abilities and powers to test against one another in a battle of tactics, strategy, and intuition.  BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.  Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose! The last player standing wins!  BattleCON: War of Indines can be played on its own or combined with other BattleCON sets to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.  ______________________________________________________________________________  BattleCON: War of Indines has two versions, now dubbed &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Remastered.&amp;quot;  The &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; version contained multiple art styles, as different fighters were drawn by different artists.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.  In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).  A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.  The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.","/boardgame/93/el-grande"

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.  In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.  For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp;amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;amp;cetera expansion: Roads &amp; Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition","/boardgame/875/roads-boats"

MacGowan   (BGG description:)  This is the 4th entry in the We the People system of games, following Hannibal and Successors (but pre-dating Paths of Glory, which is arguably more of a spin-off than a follow-on). The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements. While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre.   (Note from Mark Herman:)  The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers). To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming. The above write up is mistaken when it states that &amp;quot;For The People&amp;quot; is based on &amp;quot;Hannibal v Rome&amp;quot;, but was my second game in the &amp;quot;We The People&amp;quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.  UPDATE: The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook. This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download.","/boardgame/833/people"

It is the second volume in the Musket &amp;amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&amp;uuml;tzen in 1632.  The Musket &amp;amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.  Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.  The four battles in Sweden Fights On are:       N&amp;ouml;rdlingen 1634    Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&amp;ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.       Wittstock 1636   The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&amp;eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&amp;eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.       2nd Breitenfeld 1642    Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&amp;ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.       Jankau 1645    Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign aginst the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emporer himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.

Yomi is a fighting game in card form in which physical dexterity is replaced by hand management skills. Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.  Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.  Game Modes       1v1, the main mode      2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom      A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent      A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters     Gameplay       Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.      Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.      Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.      Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.      Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.      Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.     The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.

Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.  Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.  Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.  This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the &amp;quot;Front&amp;quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.","/boardgame/77/eastfront"

Emphasis is on infantry combat.  Crossfire is an innovative set of rules very unlike most other systems out there.  &amp;quot;Turns&amp;quot; (having the &amp;quot;initiative&amp;quot; is the term in Crossfire which loosely matches the concept of a &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot;) are not sequential (as in &amp;quot;step 1 movement, step 2 artillery fire, step 3 melee, etc, etc&amp;quot;) and distances and moves are not measured (we do some measurement in our house rules).  This different approach makes for a breathlessly exciting game system where critical situations are developed realistically and resolved quickly. The mechanics also make for amazingly quick games.  Scenarios that have previously taken more than a day to complete are finished within a few hours.  Once you try this game, you won't want to go back to others, believe me!  Crossfire focuses on infantry action at the company level with squads as the smallest element. Some people play with house rules which add more detail to the armor rules - but the existing rules work fine as Crossfire is primarily and infantry orientated rule set.  Crossfire is actually a step up from our 1:1 preferences, with figures mounted on stands of 2-3 figures representing a squad.  This was a bit of a nervous jump from 1:1 for me, but the result has been very rewarding.  I think one of the reasons I like it so much is that the idea of squads moving about is a bit like Avalon Hill's Squad Leader which we played years and years ago.  That was a great game.

Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a ""laboratory"" for what would become the Portuguese Empire.  Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.  Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries. Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.  The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.  Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&amp;rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors? Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large&amp;hellip;.","/boardgame/95527/madeira"

Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.  The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.  Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.  The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.","/boardgame/77423/lord-rings-card-game"

Selling and buying shares on the stock market, seeking new sources of funding, laying track and placing stations, running trains and paying dividends are all basic elements of 18xx games.  In addition, 1865 Sardinia has several features that make it different from other 18xx titles. The most important distinctions are:       a traffic based system that makes calculating company's revenues easier and faster      foreign investors (Dragons) trade in certificates in addition to human players      an absorption mechanism that allows companies to acquire each other     Other interesting points:       before phase 5, all companies start as minor companies with 40%/20%/20%/20% shares      converting a company from minor to major requires a direct route from a company base to a historical destination city      private companies become 2 trains when transferred to a company and also provide extra traffic      buying trains from bank makes the share price jump up      the last 2, 3, and 4 train comes with a discount      withholding money in company doesn't reduce the share price      tiles can be replaced with another tile of same color, provided the current connections are retained      bankrupt players are given enough loans to keep them in game, loans are then deducted from final score in the end     				 				 					Dragons        during stock rounds, the Dragons will also trade      each stock round begins with a Dragon and Dragons also play between each player      dragons are interested in company's rank, an indicator based on the sum of trains phase and tokens on board, followed on a special table on the board      dragons will immediately sell certificates in companies ranked red and will buy certificates ranked green, according to a fairly simple and consistent algorithm.      players can buy shares from Dragons, but must pay a premium for well-ranked shares      share prices are adjusted down when shares are sold by Dragons or the company president   				 				 					Traffic system        when a company places a station marker, it gets to collect traffic chips from the board along the route      mines also produce traffic chips, but diminish in value as the game proceeds      each traffic chip is worth $10 in revenue      revenues are the smaller value of total revenue in traffic chips and train capacity available      phase 2 trains, for example, have 8 capacity each, so if company has two of those for 16 capacity and 14 traffic chips, it will make $140 in revenue, while adding three chips would increase the revenue to $160 because the capacity hits the roof at that point","/boardgame/87907/1865-sardinia"

As I grabbed for the hatch, I was already giving the order to the gunner to traverse the turret. ""Schnell."" One comprehensive glance had taken it all in and fear all but overwhelmed me. Not 50 yards away, a slowly-rising wisp of white smoke gave away the position of the 45mm anti-tank gun pointed straight at the panzer, pointed...so it seemed anyway, straight between my eyes. ""Hard Right!"" Beyond it were supporting Russian infantry&amp;mdash;all too visible now behind their chattering small arms fire and the louder, staccato hammering of a supporting heavy machine gun. ""CLANG"" The tank shuddered with the reverberation of a direct hit against the front of the revolving turret. The added 30mm of frontal armour had saved them this time. Now quickly before they can reload...""Fire.""   This is CROSS OF IRON...a gripping game of tactical combat on the Russian Front. Following in the footsteps of its amazingly successful predecessor, CROSS OF IRON comes replete with an entirely restructured armour and artillery system, which does for armour combat what its predecessor, SQUAD LEADER, did for infantry actions. In fact, the first thing the game instructs you to do is throw away your old artillery and armour counters to make way for their expanded revised counterparts. Each AFV now has three separate MG factors, turret position differentiation, ""button up"" penalties, and advantages, target size differentiation, varying amour modifiers and much more. CROSS OF IRON again utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 8 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The 36-page rulebook starts in where the SQUAD LEADER rules left off...at section 63 and continues on to section 103. An expanded Campaign Game enables players to simulate virtually any action of their choosing with a vastly enlarged counter mix encompassing virtually every AFV which saw action WWII...from the diminutive BT5 to the mammoth King Tiger.  CROSS OF IRON is more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER, it provides a system which can be used to portray any Eastern Front action. Be forewarned! CROSS OF IRON is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered SQUAD LEADER.   In each game you get:       520 double-printed &amp;frac12;&amp;quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that made up the combatants of the Eastern Front.      576 double-printed ⅝&amp;quot; vehicular and artillery counters encompassing the entire OB of the war in Russia.      An additional 8&amp;quot; &amp;times; 22&amp;quot; geomorphic mapboard section increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types.

The goal is to have the largest group of stones on the board when the board is full of stones, but as you get closer to winning, your opponent gets more powerful. Whereas most stone-placement games are about position, Catchup is about timing, position, and the interplay between them.  Definitions:  1. Group &amp;ndash; a set of connected, like-colored stones on the board. A single stone is also considered a group.  2. Score - your score is the number of stones contained in your largest group. At the beginning of the game, both players' scores are set to 1  Rules:  1. One player owns the white stones and the other owns the black. White begins by placing 1 stone on any empty space.   2. From then on, starting with black, players take turns. On your turn, you may place 1 or 2 stones, or up to 3 if your opponent's score increased on their last turn and is, at the beginning of your turn, greater than or equal to your score.  3. After taking your turn, if your score has changed, move your pawn to the corresponding spot on the scoring track.  4. The game ends when the board is full. The player with the largest group wins. If the players&amp;rsquo; largest groups are the same size, compare their second-largest groups, and so on, until you come to a pair which aren&amp;rsquo;t the same size. Whoever owns the larger of the two wins.","/boardgame/68199/catchup"

Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.  To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.  Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.  Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]  Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.  The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location. The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.  The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.  Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase. Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!  The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!  Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).  Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.

With roots tracing back to the classic Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.   A World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.","/boardgame/7614/world-war"

Contact with the &amp;quot;Shake and bake&amp;quot; colony is lost. The Company sends a team of Colonial Marines, with Ripley as &amp;quot;Advisor&amp;quot;, to find out what has happened at Hadley's Hope.  Aliens: This Time it's War is an unauthorised, non-profit and non-collectable card game set within the boundaries of the hugely influential 1986 sci-fi film, Aliens.  Consisting of two balanced 60-card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs.  At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry.  The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and &amp;quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit.&amp;quot;  The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Aliens: This Time it's War is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive melees. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards.  Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco, but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance.  Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. No icons are used.  Aliens: This Time it's War can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, BattleTech CCG, and Iliad.  Victory Conditions:        The Colonial Marine player wins if she manages to &amp;quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit&amp;quot;.      The Colonial Marine player wins if she reaches and survives the Sulaco Loading Bay battle.      The Alien player wins if Ripley and all the Colonial Marines are either killed or cocooned.","/boardgame/69851/aliens-time-its-war"

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.  Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.  After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.  The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.  The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.","/boardgame/9216/goa"

A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.  Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&amp;mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.  A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame  From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&amp;rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&amp;mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.  Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire  Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.  GMT COIN Series, Volume I  Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).  A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.   GMT COIN Series Volume II is Cuba Libre—Castro's Insurgency 1957-1958, Volume III is A Distant Plain—Insurgency in Afghanistan, and Volume IV is Fire in the Lake—Insurgency in Vietnam.

Players take actions such as contracting men, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.  Each player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.  There are several undiscovered lands that allow players, once discovered, to found some colonies there. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.  At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.","/boardgame/66589/navegador"

These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.

The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:        Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!

Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.

A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.","/boardgame/84/rommel-desert"

Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding ""size.""  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).  Players then ""shuffle build"" a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&amp;rsquo;s strategy for winning. The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&amp;rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.  Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.  The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is ""trouble with tribbles."" Some of these encounters also give victory points.  Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.","/boardgame/79127/star-trek-fleet-captains"

As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne. A solitary traveler stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne. My lord Morcar, we come bearings grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee. The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence. I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor&amp;rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants. With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows. Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako. An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue. Fanrax, the Malicious. At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group. Boroush, the Storm Master. With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees. And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes. The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party. I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure. With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows.

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.  Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.  (from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)  This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.  Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &amp;quot;technology tree,&amp;quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.","/boardgame/71/civilization"

This solitaire game, suitable for group and classroom cooperative game play, tells the story of the English Civil Wars (1640-53) through its key events and decision points. You attempt to stop the advance of four armies bent on destroying Parliament and Puritanism, whom you represent; simply holding on to London is not enough.  Each of the three English Civil Wars are replayed through the use of separate card decks that recreate the historical military and political events that could spell doom to the Parliamentarian forces. There are civil wars going on not just in England, but in Scotland and Ireland too; and each will have varying impact on the play of the game at different times.  The title comes from the purported response to the beheading of King Charles by his implacable foe, Oliver Cromwell, who remarked that this act of regicide was a ""cruel necessity.""  Note: Cruel Necessity is our first Gold Banner wargame to exclude a mounted map inside. Because of all the gameplay real estate in Cruel Necessity, mounting the boards using our print-on-demand publishing model would have raised the Retail Price to $55.00 (i.e., a $15 increase), and that just seemed like too much.

The two separate battles shown in this game are named for the main objective city on each map, Mozhaysk to the west of Moscow, and Mtsensk to the south. Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.  Historically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&amp;rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.  Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves. The game includes special rules for Soviet rocket artillery, NKVD, and self-propelled gun units, and fuel supply shortages, and much more, all without overwhelming play of the game.

Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.  From the designer: Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.","/boardgame/9625/struggle-empires"

What this does is that it allows each situation to be gamed as its own little tactical puzzle&amp;mdash;making it such that a player might be ""winning"" in one region while ""losing"" in another, at the same time. Both players are always ""in the game.""    While the Allied player is busy dropping paratroopers, establishing bridgeheads and running a ground offensive to link up with them, the German player must devastate the airborne forces clinging to Arnhem, defend the various river crossings and counterattack to sever the Allied supply lines. Both players are attacking and defending at the same time, every turn.    Following on the heels of Bastogne, It Never Snows uses a tactical model with a minimal amount of rules overhead which shows both set-piece as well as ""on the fly"" attacks and the effects of indirect fires and air support.    A fantastically detailed OOB shows the insane array of German units being scratched together to defeat the Allied offensive&amp;mdash;from displaced sailors to the deaf, from elite armor to barely trained school units, from highly motivated SS to penal units being pushed into battle at gunpoint. Against the elite airborne troops of the Allies, this menagerie is hardly the German army many wargamers envision when they think of World War II.  Scenarios:       Campaign. All five maps, all 17 turns. The full meal with players selecting their own landing sites.      Historical Drop Zones Campaign. Almost the same as the above, only with the actual drop sites listed so that players can see the real thing and not have to do that planning themselves.     Sept 18: Foothold. Here the initial drops have already happened and the battle is underway. By passing on the first turn air drops, this is a much quicker version of the campaign.     Sept 20: High Water Mark. This 12 turn game places the player in the shoes of the Allies at the very moment the success (or failure) of the campaign is determined.     The Witches Cauldron. A small map area scenario covering the defense of Oosterbeek.     Hold Until Relieved. The battle for Arnhem in a small map area and only 6 turns.     Hail Mary, Full of Grace.

This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card&amp;mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller.

If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.  Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier&amp;ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2.

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.  Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities. There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.  The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.  Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.

Feb. 27: The burning of the Reichstag. Hitler blames his political opponents and enacts repressive laws. Mar. 5: The Nazi Party wins the Federal elections amid a climate of fear and intimidation. From this point on, with a precise and constant rhythm, Hitler dismantles all of the democratic institutions of the fragile Weimar Republic and inaugurates a reign of terror, gradually establishing a ruthless and violent dictatorial regime.  The above is history, but what would have happened if instead of bringing Europe into a maelstrom of war, the infamous Austrian corporal had abandoned his plan of global domination and taken the path of peace? Would World War II still have broken out? Or would the Nazi hierarchy and German industry still have pushed the F&amp;uuml;hrer to war with Poland? What would the dream of a Greater Germany have been without Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the other German territorial claims? Would the Western plutocrats or the Soviet colossus have fought the fascist dictatorship anyway and nevertheless inexorably triggered global conflict?  Democracy under Siege is an interactive simulation enabling you to explore all such questions. A card-driven strategy game, it reproduces the geopolitical conflicts and political struggles that led to the Second World War. The game covers the period 1933-1940 and is designed for two or three players. Each takes the role of one of the three ideologies &amp;mdash; Democracy, Nazism and Communism &amp;mdash; that struggled for power during the timeline of the game. (When played by two players, the two Ideologies exclusively under player control are Democracy and Nazism, while control of Communism alternates between the two players from turn to turn according to specific rules.)  Each game turn represents one year and is divided into three or four rounds. Players choose one political action and one event per round and attempt to perform the political action by rolling a die and applying some modifiers. They can affect the outcomes of their attempts by expending the ideology's political prestige. Events are activated immediately before the political actions are attempted; no die roll is required. If the political action succeeds, the card effects are applied accordingly. In any case, even when the attempt is unsuccessful, the political action cards played provide a varying number of political points (PP) that can later be expended by the players to perform activities.  After political actions, players perform their action round with the PP provided by political action cards. Players can influence the political allegiance of minor countries, exploit the economic resources belonging either to minor nations or to their controlled powers, recruit and activate coup cells to attempt coups d'etat to overthrow a minor country regime, send military forces to local conflicts or intervene in a civil war in a minor nation. All of these activities, as well as the effects of successful political actions, can bring victory points (VP) when the political allegiances of minor countries come under the influence or the control of Ideologies, or when territories or nations are conquered.  At the end of each round, players check the outcomes of coup attempts, then proceed to a new round. During the clean-up phase at the end of each turn, players perform end-turn checks and calculate the production of military resources (MR) by the exploitation of economic resources claimed on the map. MR are put in the ideologies' force pool and expended to maintain the minor nations allegiances. The remaining MR provide additional VP and can be employed during the subsequent turns to intervene in local conflicts and civil wars.  Democracy under Siege offers an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by 108 strategy cards. Players exploit historical events and political actions to achieve political supremacy. Wars are simulated by an abstract combat system that allows players to intervene and influence their outcomes. The main concepts reproduced in the game are the ideological struggles among the major powers, the race for armaments ahead of World War II and the buildup of a network of diplomatic links with minor nations. All of these elements combine to determine victory.","/boardgame/90568/democracy-under-siege"

Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.  Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &amp;quot;rate&amp;quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.  This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.  Included within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitaire play.

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.  Belongs to the Catan Series.  The game changes the base game in three main ways:  First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.  Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)  Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.","/boardgameexpansion/926/catan-cities-knights"

The three maps cover the area from the far north of Denmark, through Germany and Austria to the industrial heartland of Italy.  The standard rules constitute the fast game, and contain all the rules necessary to play &amp;quot;The Next War&amp;quot; land game - a complete game that can be played independently. The most notable mechanic is the combination of combat within the movement of land units, with the ability of units to greatly exceed the basic movement allowance at increased risk of fatigue/attrition.  Optional rules cover weather, supply, chemical/nuclear warfare, air and naval operations, airborne/airmobile and amphibious operations, helicopters and special forces, and electronic warfare and add can considerably to the record keeping and playing time.  The campaign game covers the first 60 days after mobilization in three basic scenarios, Sudden War, Spring Maneuvers, Tension. The differences between these three concern the timing of the outbreak of war and the resultant state of readiness of the respective forces.

In October, 1973, Syria and her allies lead a surprise attack to recapture the Golan Heights in conjunction with an Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal into the Sinai.  For a little over two weeks, massed Syrian armor tried to swamp the Israeli defenders who were buying time to allow mobilized reserves to arrive.  They succeeded and managed to turn the tide launching their own offensive toward Damascus.  Heights of Courage is the 16th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. It complements the 1995 CSR award winning game Yom Kippur (which covers the fighting in the Sinai). It uses the same 8 page standard series rulebook applicable to all the other games.  Because both sides have offensive and defensive phases of the battle to enjoy, victory is determined by comparing the best Syrian performance in their early offensive to the Israeli offensive results at the end of the game. This forces both sides to fight tooth and nail on both the offense and defense with enormous time pressure on perform rapidly.  The game captures all the sizzle of the fast-paced armored battle with enough steak to give the game the appropriate level of depth. For example, it uses an innovative two tempo operational speed, to both players as the battle goes beyond the endurance of the forces involved.  Each player can select to go ""fast"" in order to fight more or ""slow"" in order to get more replacements.  While Heights of Courage cannot be directly linked to Yom Kippur, the game provides rules to allow players to play both games in tandem so as to play the ""whole war.""  Four scenarios allow different looks at the 17 turn campaign (turn length varies based on when a cease-fire occurs). 4.1 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (17 turn long version) 4.2 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (10 turn short version) 4.3 Operation Badhr (6 turn look at the initial Syrian offensive) 4.4 Operation Al-Owda (Original Syrian plan - which can be played in the 6, 10 or 17 turn versions)  Game Scale: Game Turn: Half day to 3 days (depending on game turn) Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers Units: Platoon/Task Force/Brigade  Game Inventory: One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheet One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&amp;quot; counters) One 16-page Heights of Courage rulebook One 8-page Standard Combat Series ver 1.7 rulebook Two 6-sided die  Solitaire Playability: High Complexity Level: Medium Players: 2 or more Playing Time: 4-15 hours","/boardgame/84834/heights-courage"

Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?  In Lancaster, the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to being the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood, as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.  Every turn, players send their knights to the different locations: &amp;bull; Counties, where they compete with knights from other players for rewards and the favor of the nobles. &amp;bull; The castle, to receive income or new knights. &amp;bull; Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points.

Your meager beginnings will influence the paths you must take. Lead your people well and they will take you to infinite heights of greatness. If civilization manages to endure the ages, your name will hang in every whisper of its legacy...  Fantasy Flight Games is excited to announce the upcoming release of Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s Civilization: The Board Game!

Designed by Kevin Wilson, Civilization: The Board Game is inspired by the legendary video game series created by Sid Meier. Players are tasked with guiding an entire civilization throughout the ages, taking ownership of your people&amp;rsquo;s technology, economy, culture, and military, as well as all the choices that go along with them. There are four different paths to victory, and each is riddled with opposition.  In Civilization: The Board Game, 2-4 players take on the roles of famous leaders in charge of historical civilizations, each with their own abilities. Players will be able to explore a module game board, build cities and buildings, fight battles, research powerful technology, and attract great people by advancing their culture. No matter what your play style is, there is a civilization for you!  Fans of Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s classic video game franchise will find familiar footing in Civilization: The Board Game. Staying true to the foundations of its video game predecessor while creating a new and unique way to play, Civilization: The Board Game captures the spirit and grandeur of carving out a magnificent empire from modest beginnings.  Players start off with a single city, one army figure, and one scout, and from these meager origins you must forge through the ages and become the greatest civilization in the world.  Those unfamiliar with the video game series will find Civilization: The Board Game a great way to enter into the world of Civilization. The strategy and tactical decisions involved in Civilization: The Board Game will appeal to strategy gamers and war gamers alike, and the ability to win through culture and technological advancement will give those who only wish to focus on their own empire a chance at victory as well.","/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-board-game"

Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.  The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.  As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.  Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.  Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules. Strategically, however, it is comparably deep and complex.","/boardgame/99630/rolling-stock"

The goal of the game is to become the most famous patron of the arts by hiring the most famous artists of the period and financing their works.  Each player can commission artworks in his own district, the Cathedral, or in the civic buildings of the city. Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&amp;rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&amp;rsquo;s primary source of victory points.  All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance. Most of them worked in Florence. All of the buildings in the game were real Renaissance workshops. The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.  Note from the designers directly from the rulebook:  &amp;quot;We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture. Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&amp;mdash;and the Renaissance period&amp;mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time. We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook. They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era. The names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period. Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&amp;rsquo;t know. We hope you agree with our choice, and we hope you have a good time playing Florenza!&amp;quot;","/boardgame/81640/florenza"

The game is designed by David Brain, who was a playtester on some of the earlier Key games.  The game is the first game published by R&amp;amp;D Games that has not been designed by Richard Breese.  Richard this time takes on the role of developer and the game consequently has the same look and feel as the previous Key games, with artwork again by Juliet Breese plus its own set of ani-/vegi-/arti-meeples.  Each player controls an extended family of workers.  Over the course of two years, players will organise their workers in an attempt to turn their initial scanty resources into a thriving economic system.  After an initial set up phase, the game is played over eight seasons.  Each season has three distinct phases, during which players may take a variety of actions.  The topography, weather, and seasons will influence the ability of workers to produce crops and livestock in the fields and luxuries in the villages.  In addition, resources and luxuries may be bought and sold in the market, or gold and favours sought and acquired.  Other workers may be sponsored to join the powerful guilds, where they will acquire skills as they gain promotion to become craftsmen or even the guild master.  Turn order throughout the game is determined by the player&amp;rsquo;s position on the season track, which changes at the end of each season.  At the end of the game, the player who has acquired the most gold will win the game.  David Brain&amp;rsquo;s designer notes on the box sides conclude by stating that &amp;lsquo;Key Market is a reasonably intricate game.  Some of the strategies that can be employed (particularly the effective use of the market) are not immediately apparent, and some of the Guild combinations do not look so devastating at first glance.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.  During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.

Code-named Typhoon, Germany expected this final offensive to destroy all Soviet armies in front of Moscow in a classic double-envelopment by the Panzer divisions. In short, the Germans expected Typhoon to end the war in the east. Spearheading the German attack was Army Group Center, General Guderian's PanzerArmee, with some 90,000 men in 70 divisions. Facing them, blocking the way to the Soviet seat of power, were over 800,000 Soviet troops in 95 divisions.  The German assault was ferocious and incessant and came within sight of the Moscow Kremlin. Although their attacks ripped gaping holes in the Soviet lines, the defenders did not disintegrate, as the Germans expected. After suffering huge losses in the opening battles, the Soviets reinforced the front line with Siberian and other reserves numbering perhaps 1.2 million men.  The battle for Moscow proved to be one of the decisive battles of the Second World War. Now, you can replay this epic struggle for supremacy in the east. The game's easy-to-play system allows the players to focus on the critical matters of operational maneuver and force coordination, while adding just enough chrome to faithfully recreate the key elements of the campaign.

The players have to choose only one aspect of the card to use when it is played. Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player's deck.  From the box description:  A war fought at the edge of two mighty empires. For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.  A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored. How quickly should you build up your forces, do you employ Native Americans, what energy should be expended on your economy?  The game is about more than just fighting &amp;ndash; you must successfully colonize the land to have a chance.","/boardgame/79828/few-acres-snow"

The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.  The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &amp;quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&amp;quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.  The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.  The troops of each side are represented by &amp;lsquo;unit&amp;rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.  Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys ""suspect"" markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these ""suspect"" markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.  The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &amp;ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &amp;lsquo;top-down&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;bottom-up&amp;rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.  At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.  A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.  No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.","/boardgame/8045/princes-renaissance"

An alliance of Dwarves and Men are pitted in a battle of survival against the evil hordes of Goblins and the nefarious Undead. To win, players recruit massive armies, build cities, develop technology, and conquer territory in an effort to defeat their opponents by ultimately capturing their homeland. Beyond the mere battling of armies and world conquest, players direct the development of heroes to explore dungeons, battle fierce creatures, and gain valuable treasure and spells that can be used to turn the tides of war against their foes.  Player turns are broken into three phases:       Movement Phase: An army can move all of their units during this phase.        Combat Phase: An army engages in all battles and resolves all dungeons on this phase.        Collection &amp;amp; Placement Phase: An army marks all new territories they have conquered with their control markers, adjusts their new income level. An army spends their money on new units, develops or researches the ability to acquire new units, builds new cities and/or upgrades their capital city.   To win players must either destroy an enemy capital city or achieve an economic victory.","/boardgame/94255/warparty"

Both sides are as evenly matched as one gets during the war, and there is a constant stream of reinforcement keeping both players in the game up to the end.  2nd Bull Run is one of General Robert E. Lee's greatest victories, in which he smashed John Pope's politically riddled Union army, setting the stage for the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) several weeks later.  Red Badge of Courage uses version 4.3 of the GBACW system, building on lessons learned from the two previous battle games in the series. And the game not only includes the two complete battles, but it has a half dozen smaller scenarios that enable you to play various aspects of the battle in detail, many in a day.

Players are tycoons in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; a time when traditional craftsman were being rapidly replaced with steam-powered machines. Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.  Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.  In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.  According to Wallace, &amp;quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time. The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other.&amp;quot;","/boardgame/65901/age-industry"

Magazine's Manager of the Year!  Once a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.  Managers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.  Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.  The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends. Players then tally up their total fans and the manager with the most fans wins the game.","/boardgame/90137/blood-bowl-team-manager-card-game"

To bid, lay aside three cards from your hand; the suit of those cards determines how many tricks you must take (each club is three tricks, heart two tricks, spade one trick, diamond zero tricks).

Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.  As with a lot of games, London is about scoring the most VPs.  Players manage their hand, selecting cards to play into their building display by laying them out in a line.  At some point a player will choose to run his city. They can activate their buildings in whatever order they prefer.  The resulting actions can generate money and VPs, reduce poverty or have some other effect specified on the card.

Depending on the time of day. More often than not, Ogre duels are vast eating competitions. Although violent brawls make a good substitute. As enemies, Ogres are ruthless foes who show no mercy once their appetite has been whetted. Anyone brave enough to do battle with Ogres must be sure of their own fighting prowess. Otherwise, they might not end up just dead, they&amp;rsquo;ll end up as someone&amp;rsquo;s dinner!    Ogres are not evil as such. Just permanently hungry and frighteningly violent. Often they just wander about alone. At other times they group together in clans led by an Ogre Lord, also known as a Tyrant. These are some of the meanest, nastiest and hungriest of all Ogres. It is possible for both the Empire and the forces of Chaos to hire Ogres as mercenaries, so long as they are guaranteed a good time, a brawl and plenty to eat (usually as a result of the fighting).

What resulted was the most intense armored and mechanized combat since World War II. And this is what the game of BAR-LEV is all about.  Using two highly detailed map boards, BAII.-LEV completely captures all the fluidity of this, the Yom Kippur War. Everything is there. For the Israelis you have battalions of Centurians, M60, M48 and Super-Sherman tanks plus a wide variety of mechanized infantry. Also, you have all their artillery to support this fast moving array. For their big counterattack, the Israelis will be using everything from the long ranging 175mm guns to captured Russian 130mm cannons.  In the air, the combat is equally exciting. The Air Module is almost a complete game in itself. Once again everything is there. The Israelis have Mirage III's, Skyhawks and the deadly Phantoms; all individually represented. There are even separate counters for both Huey and Chinook helicopters.  And now pouring across the canal and up the Golan Heights come the Arabs. With their low silhouette T-62's and fast moving BTR personal carriers, they represent a formidable challenge to Israel.  And they too are accurately represented , complete with Saggar anti-tank missiles and both mobile and fixed SAM sites. Their air force also has individual counters for the MIG-21's, 19, and a few 23's, in addition to SU-7 and SU-11's. They too, have their divisional and corp level artillery. All of it is there.  BAR-LEV is not just another scenario but the most complete ond accurate simulation of modern air and mechanized combgt yet designed. Each major participant h'as over a 150 military counters.  BAR-LEV is played in daily turns and may be fought with or without a &amp;quot;cease-fire&amp;quot;. It is an open-ended game, with the &amp;quot;what-ifs&amp;quot; limited only by your imagination.

War is raging across Europe and Russia. Napoleon, emperor of France, is seeking to dominate Europe through conquest. France&amp;rsquo;s enemies, led by England, are engaged in a desperate struggle to defeat Napoleon. England, in dire need of men, is impressing men to serve in its navy. Included are Americans who are pressed into service at gunpoint.  The young American nation objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United States declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British Army being occupied in its struggles against Napoleon, American forces invade Canada in order to drive the British from its last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another front.  In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on one of the roles of the major factions that took part in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; and the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American players. Players for each side will cooperate with each other in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective Areas on the map.

The laboratories of the Hybrid Code, private of resources, die out in their turn and sink in the lapse of memory.  The Age of Darkness.  The incommensurable energy released by the ritual of the Paddle, in the heart of Second Shamir, flows through the continent of Aarklash and reactivates the disastrous sanctuaries of the Hybrid Code...  Nowadays, in Akkylannie.  The population of the village of Glasinhar must face a terrible threat to which it is not prepared: monsters emerge from the entrails of the ground and are devoted to a massacre.

Hybrid Game Box  Before disappearing, Dirz the Heresiarch, founder of the Empire of the Scorpion, nourished a shadowy project: Code Hybrid. Many decades later, Dirz's forgotten laboratories mysteriously reactivated themselves... Today, monsters spring from the innards of the earth!

Presented in preview at the time of the last show of the Monde de Jeu, HYBRID is the new game of the Rackham range.  Although the action proceeds in the universe of Aarklash, the principles of play are very different from those of Confrontation and Rag' Narok : the game of Hybrid proceeds on richly detailed, square modular game tiles.  You can achieve the ten perilous missions suggested in the basic booklet or to invent your own laboratories!  The mechanisms are also innovative: Hybrid is played with dice with d10&amp;rsquo;s. The capacities of each combatant are described in four characteristics to which many special Aptitudes are added, as the ability to emit an aura of battle or to become stronger after each death inflicted upon the enemy. The tables of Capacities, as for them, describe the prowesses that your warrior can carry out at the critical times in the battle!  The basic box contains two factions: the Griffons of Akkylannie, represented by Templars of Hod , and the impious creatures of the Alchemists of Dirz . These figurines is delivered with the reference cards which also make it possible to play them Confrontation and Rag' Narok. All are compatible: the majority of the references for Confrontation and Rag' Narok will be able, in the long term, to be used within the framework of the Hybrid game.  Templars of Hod include Worthy Ambrosius , wise equipped with mysterious capacities, like three R&amp;eacute;purgateurs and their Seneshal , of frightening warriors trained with the special operations.  Against the combatants of the Light, the children of the H&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;siarque are short handed: not less than four Plagues of Flesh the corridors in the search of victims. Three Hybrids represent the prototype of the warrior of excellence imagined formerly by Dirz itself. The Alchemical perfection carries a name and a horrible face: Aberration . Nothing seems to be able to stop this living nightmare which has the power of a machine of war and the speed of an unforeseeable storm...  Note finally that the amateurs of conversion were not forgotten: the arms of R&amp;eacute;purgateurs and Hybrid are interchangeable and make it possible to create several models starting from the same base.

The game covers the pivotal air combat over the Arras sector, France from March until the end of May 1917. Players take on the roles of Royal Flying Corps commander or German Imperial Air Service commander for their respective sides and will have a multitude of taskings available to accomplish and complete their objectives. Bloody April will include both single mission scenarios and multi-mission/multi-day campaigns to allow players to play out large scale battles in a manageable timeframe.  Bloody April recreates entire air raids in detail. Each player will have many unique tactical challenges to overcome. Both players will have numerous taskings available such as Bombing, Recon, Artillery Cooperation, Contact Patrols, Balloon Busting, Offensive Patrols, Line Patrols and Trench Strafing. Players will also have Anti-Aircraft systems available such as different caliber &amp;quot;Archie&amp;quot;, AA guns and &amp;quot;Flaming Onions&amp;quot; incendiary weapons to hinder their opponent&amp;rsquo;s movements. The map covers a significant portion of the Arras sector from Bethune and Lens in the North to Cambrai in the South. All the major aerodromes in this theatre of operations are displayed on map with a scale of 1nm per hex and 2 minutes per game turn. Each detailed aircraft counter will represent anywhere from 1 to 5 aircraft.  The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) player will be on the offensive during this timeframe and have a plethora of diverse aircraft types ranging from obsolete but workhorse B.E.2 2-seaters to brand new aircraft that would become legendary as the war went on such as the SE-5 scout and Bristol F.2a 2-seater. In all the RFC player will have over 15 different types of scout and 2-seater aircraft at their disposal. Pusher type F.E.2b/d and D.H.2 aircraft and the Sopwith Triplane will help fill your arsenal. Sopwith Pups and 1 &amp;frac12; Strutters, Nieuport 17s and SPAD VIIs are some of the other types available. R.E.8s and F.K.8s will help augment your 2-seater fleet and will begin to replace the heavily attrited B.E.2 fleet.  The German Imperial Air Service player takes on the role of Jagdstaffeln (Jasta) commander utilizing Ace pilots such as the legendary &amp;quot;Red Baron&amp;quot;, Manfred von Richthofen and his Jasta 11 comrades flying Halberstadt and Albatros scout aircraft that terrorized the British 2-seaters during this period. The German player will also have his own 2-seater aircraft such as the Rumpler and Albatros C-class 2-seaters to provide Recon, Bombing and Artillery Cooperation. The battle for the skies over Arras in France 1917 is under your control. Will it be another Bloody April ?

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.  A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.  Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.  From the publisher:  Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &amp;quot;Setting&amp;quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.  Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets.  With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game.  Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness.  Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone.

It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor.

There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;LUNA&amp;quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.  The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &amp;quot;worker movement&amp;quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.  LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.","/boardgame/70512/luna"

After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&amp;rsquo;s entrance into World War One.  Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.  After many years of being the ""Sick man of Europe,"" by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.  This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.  The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.  Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered. Can you lead the Ottomans in the Great War and achieve victory where your historical counterparts failed?

This epic struggle lasted from 1568 until 1648 and eventually brought independence to Holland and the northern provinces. In the south, the revolt was less successful and Belgium did not emerge as an independent state until after the Napoleonic era.  During the initial stages of the struggle, William of Orange became the symbol of freedom. His main adversary was the Spanish King Philip II, who sent in the Duke of Alba with his formidable conquistadores to stop the rebellion.  Revolution depicts a power struggle with many facets. Each player represents one of the principal factions involved: the Catholics, Habsburgs, Nobility, Burghers and Reformers. Each faction has its particular goals, which are often partly common. Although factions may sometimes co-operate, they are not allies for long and easily turn on each other if the situation calls for this.  Historically, there were periods of open warfare and others of uneasy peace. The reforming factions gradually became more established, particularly in the north and along the coast. The once supreme Habsburg armies were slowly driven out of these areas through a series of siege battles. The defeat of the mighty Armada by a combined Dutch/English fleet in 1588 cost the Spaniards dearly. The Catholics were eventually allowed to retain some of their influence, while the local Nobility, initially catholic but with local sympathies, succeeded or failed according to their willingness to accept the changed circumstances.  This game is not a detailed military re-enactment of the Eighty Years' War. It tries to capture the flavor of these interesting times in a much broader sense. It contains an element of warfare in the form of battles and sieges but the main theme is built on economic, religious and political control. The constantly shifting balance of power, caused by temporary alliances, makes Revolution an immensely challenging game, and not for the faint hearted. Clever and timely use of available resources, including those of foreign sympathizers and allies, is needed to achieve ultimate success.  Revolution: The Dutch Revolt was more than 15 years in the making, and marks Francis Tresham's long-awaited return to the forefront of game design. He is most famous for his widely acclaimed board games Civilization and 1829.  Revolution: The Dutch Revolt includes 1 large gameboard, 41 playing cards, 416 colorful game pieces (56 resource pieces in each of 5 colors, 8 army pieces in each of 5 colors, 47 neutral pieces, 3 water beggars, 1 VP marker for each color, 1 game turn marker and 40 status markers), 1 player aid card and 1 rules booklet.","/boardgame/9215/revolution-dutch-revolt-1568-1648"

At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank.

To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.  In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&amp;rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&amp;rsquo;s endless supply of gold.  Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&amp;rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!  Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.  Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &amp;ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&amp;rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&amp;rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&amp;rsquo;t), the sight of your army&amp;rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!","/boardgame/67492/battles-westeros"

Each victory area and functioning port that the Allies secure adds a &amp;lsquo;Fading Italian Morale&amp;rsquo; Event Chit into the selection cup, and as each of those are drawn, worsening effects on Italian units are felt along the entire front.  If one side has not secured an automatic victory by the end of turn 9, the Axis player receives bonuses, both for German units that have exited off the island through Messina and also for areas on Sicily that are still Axis-controlled, so there is pressure on both sides to fight for every area.  Event Chits include:        Replacements      Fading Italian Morale,      the Patton Soldier Slap, and      flanking battalion-sized invasions.","/boardgame/68260/fab-sicily"

The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people. From a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.  Bibracte 58BC      Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.  The Rhine 58BC      Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.  The Sabis 57BC      Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.  Bay of Biscay 56BC      The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.  Britannia 55BC      Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.  Lutetia 52BC      There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.  Game Features:          Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.         Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.         For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.         A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.         All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.         Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.         The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.         A system that is perfect for solitaire play.

Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.  Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &amp;ndash; and you're not required to do either &amp;ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.  One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &amp;ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.  Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.","/boardgame/98229/pictomania"

Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!  Then, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!) by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.  Fresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.","/boardgame/66188/fresco"

The major hook in this game is the coal trains, which run mainly West-East, taking coal from the mountains to the coast, while the passenger trains run the North-South routes.  Also interesting is the fact that all railroads operate with just the President's share sold, and open with 5 shares and expand to 10 at the owner's discretion.","/boardgame/7218/18va"

David Isby : From the Designers Notes &amp;quot;As I write this I am sitting at my typewriter in my extremely comfortable office, a mug of hot, sweet tea by my right hand, and telling you what the Battle of Cambrai was like. That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&amp;quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.  To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.  To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.  Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side. Each Game Turn is equivalent to 24 hours.

Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.  In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.  Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.","/boardgame/8217/san-juan"

Although greatly outnumbered, the British dominated by outmaneuvering the Italians with their superior armored vehicles. In the battles of Sidi Barani, Bardia, Tobruk, and Mechili, the Italian 10th Army had been soundly defeated but remained intact to defend the gates of Tripoli.  On this, the 58th day of the offensive, the remaining operational tanks of 7th British Armoured Division and a small advanced detachment of men, guns, and armored cars are attempting to block the last escape route for the Italians.  The Italians, yet unaware of the fast approaching Western Desert blocking force, will soon find themselves desperately racing against time to break through near the small village of Beda Fomm and escape into Tripolitania before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.  The time is 1200 hrs, 5 February 1941  The complete destruction of the remnants of the Italian 10th Army hangs in the balance.  				 				 					The Game  Beda Fomm marks the triumphant return of one of the truly classic gaming gems originally released in 1979 by Game Designers Workshop during what many consider the heyday of traditional conflict simulation gaming. This fast-playing, operational-level game of the Battle of Beda Fomm represents a classic blend of simple gaming mechanics with nail-biting action suitable for solitaire or competition play.  Relive the drama as the British player, maneuvering your outnumbered but superior armored vehicles and supporting personnel and weapon units to cut-off and summarily destroy the retreating Italian forces. As the Italian player, you have strength in overall numbers, but your formations are brittle and are hampered by a lack of maneuverability in attempting to break through and escape complete destruction. Simple mechanics capture the flavor of desert warfare along with the unique qualities and characteristics of the opposing forces.

The game is based on Schafkopf, Ombre (bidding) and Tarock (remaining cards). The latest revision of rules as approved by both the International Skat Players Association (ISPA) and the German Skat Association (DSkV) dates back to 1998.  A play comprises two phases: first an intricate bidding process to decide the solo player who choses the type of game to be played in the second phase, the actual playing of tricks. If he wins (takes more than half the total worth of cards in the game), the solo player alone will score points equal to the announced type of game and other modifiers (listed below); otherwise, the other two players will each score the double amount of these points. Both the bid and the final score depend on        type of game announced      combination of Jacks      margin of winning (score 90+: &amp;quot;schneider&amp;quot;; take all tricks: &amp;quot;schwarz&amp;quot;)      (optional) declaration of margin of winning before the first trick is played       (optional) open play of cards      (optional) play with the initial hand (&amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; play)      (optional) doubling of scoring value: *2 (&amp;quot;Kontra&amp;quot;); re-doubling *4 (&amp;quot;Re&amp;quot;); inofficial rules allow re-doubling ad infinitum      exeption for the Ramsch variant including sub-variants: Highest total worth of cards taken as tricks is scored negatively; the score is doubled when one other player took no trick (&amp;quot;virgin&amp;quot;), also doubled for each passing of the remaining cards without exchanging, if the drafting Ramsch variant is applied (&amp;quot;geschoben&amp;quot;); a player may also try to &amp;quot;shoot the moon&amp;quot; by taking all tricks (consequently scores +120 alone when successful).     The solo player can choose between the following game modes:       Suit (one suit and Jacks are trumps)      Grand (only Jacks are trumps)      Null (no trumps, solo player only wins without tricks).      Inofficial variants:       The most popular variant is Ramsch, which is applied when no player bids for the solo. This game mode punishes players who likely avoid the risk of successfully bidding for the solo with an only mediocre, but possible hand. It follows the rules for Grand, but highest score loses (no partnerships!). Due to the sometimes extraorinarily high (negative) scores, Ramsch plays may strongly distort a player's total scoring for the evening, and is therefore not officially sanctioned.      Revolution (in three variants): bascially a Null in open play, but the counterplayers are allowed to exchange cards.     Skat gained nation wide popularity and a major development of its mechanisms in the course of the first world war. The game as it is today is a result of constant modification and refinement by countless players in the trenches of the German Western front. The current form of bidding with ascending numbers prevailed among the players, and many inofficial variants were introduced. Though first rejected by the Skat association, a lot of the so-called &amp;quot;trench rules&amp;quot; later became officially sanctioned.  The official turnament deck is a compomise that solved another dispute between the German and the International Skat Association by combining the colours of a German Suit (predominantly found in Southern and East Germany, Switzerland, Austria) with the symbols of a French Suit (predominant elsewhere in the regions where Skat is popular, foremost Northern and West Germany).","/boardgame/6819/skat"

This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe.

While fur&amp;shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system.

And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario, The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy camnpaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered Squad Leader and Cross of Iron.  In each game you get:        520 double-printed 112&amp;quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that comprised the combatants of the Western Front; 1939&amp;middot;1942.       704 double-printed 5/8&amp;quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the British.

During this period, Francesco D&amp;rsquo;Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.

The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &amp;quot;The Riddle from Verona&amp;quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope.

With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.  The player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables. The defender is more likely to retreat than be eliminated, but there is also the chance of a counter-attack to throw back the assaulting forces. The Confederate player wins by taking two starred areas, or Little Round Top.","/boardgame/65825/gettysburg"

The World is at War.  The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.  Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.  Warcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.  Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.  Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.  We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.  You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.","/boardgame/85652/dystopian-wars"

Attackers from the German 6th Army must dislodge the Russian 62nd Army and take the city of Stalingrad before the commencement of Operation Uranus. If the city could be taken, German troops could then be re-deployed to reinforce the Italian and Rumanian formations holding the flanks of along the Volga. The fiasco at Stalingrad can then be prevented.  The game is an operational level treatment of the actual streetfighting. Each turn is a day comprising of a variable number of daylight and night impulses. Units are battalions and armoured units representing AFVs in platoon and company strength. The map is on a scale of 1 inch to 500 metres, depicting the city of Stalingrad and its western approaches, divided into 74 areas divided according to terrain features, and rated for defensive suitability. Victory is determined by the number of objectives captured by the German player each week. If it exceeds the requirements for the week, he wins. If not the Russian player wins. If it is equal to the victory requirement, the game is extended by another week, with a different(higher) victory objective requirement.  Game comprises two 22&amp;quot; by 16&amp;quot; mounted mapboards, 394 counters, rules and charts.  The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Breakout: Normandy.","/boardgame/759/turning-point-stalingrad"

The term &amp;quot;phalanx&amp;quot; is used in the game to describe a connected group of two or more pieces in a straight line, either orthogonally or diagonally.

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &amp;ndash; oh, and win the game.  In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.  Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:       Take a card on display and add it to your hand.     Draw a card from any regular deck &amp;ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.     Visit the opera and spend $2.     Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.     Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.   Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &amp;ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &amp;ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.  At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.  If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.","/boardgame/97842/last-will"

Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.  Object of the Game  Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!  Game Terms and Game Play Mechanisms  Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds:  &amp;bull; Central Zone: Throughout the game, new cards are drawn from the five Galactic Decks and placed face up in the Central Zone, the game's common play area. These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.  &amp;bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).  &amp;bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.  &amp;bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.  &amp;bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.  &amp;bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.","/boardgame/98351/core-worlds"

Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &amp;ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp;amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.  Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp;amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp;amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.","/boardgame/92415/skull"

There are several ""minor"" kingdoms that come into play through the use of the Event Cards:  Arzawa (Apasa, Milawata, Mallarima, Mira, Hindawa, Hapalla), Canaan (Hazor, Qatna, Meggido and Kadesh), and Elam (Susa).  Each is trying to expand its economic reach, allowing them to build their empire to greater levels...and this will mean coming into inimical contact with each other. Gods play a major role, as do the great caravan centers of the age,bringing in luxury items from as far away as what would be Afghanistan.  And then there are the peasants and slaves which who can be most useful (some times), as well as the great techno advantages in chariotry.

Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation.  If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.  In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &amp;mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.  In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.  Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation &amp;ndash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course.","/boardgame/72225/co"

Decision Games published a second edition in 2004, with a differently styled map.  It added optional expansion rules &amp;amp; counters for Armies, Fleets, and Civilization Markers, along with additional Event Cards -- raising their number from 56 to 164.  At the start of each player's Round, Event Cards are drawn which change the strategic situation (such as Plague or Bounty) or benefit a player in various ways.  The descriptions of the Events contain a great deal of historical information, adding much interest to the game.  Each player may attempt to perform up to five &amp;quot;Endeavors&amp;quot; per 25-year long Turn.  There are six types of Endeavors:  Conquest, Pillage, Diplomacy, Defense, Fortification (including building Armies/Fleets) and Ruling. Additionally, moving Armies/Fleets and Taxation may always be performed.  Endeavor resolution is diceless; instead &amp;quot;Year Cards&amp;quot; which show an array of results for each type of Endeavor are drawn.  The card might also require a Leader Stature Check, which can change the player's Combat, Administration, and Diplomacy ratings.  Endeavor resolution is affected by the appropriate Leader rating, and the involved areas' language, religion, population, and Social State (which changes frequently).  Poor performance can lead to Unrest or Rebellion in an Area.  An area's Social State value rises and falls as a result of Events and Endeavors, and improving the Social State of your empire is an important object of play.

Players also help build the famous Citadelle.  At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&amp;eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &amp;ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.  The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed. The player with the most points is declared the winner.

During the game the players take different roles and travel from city to city in India. Their architects build palaces and houses for the maharadja.  Of course, building a palace is expensive. Therefore it is important to earn enough money in the cities.  The first player who builds seven palaces is the winner.  Players choose their actions simultaneously but reveal and resolve them in turn. Actions include generating money, building houses or palaces, manipulating the Maharaja's movements or choosing new architects (each architect has a unique power but the more powerful ones come further down the turn order).  At the end of each round the Maharaja scores the city he is currently in based on the number of buildings and players receive money accordingly. He then moves to a new city.

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.  In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)  When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.  Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.","/boardgame/9674/ingenious"

Purpose of the game is that one is the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot;, who calls out the three sentences (one by one), notes down his &amp;quot;WALTERS&amp;quot; (his propositions numbered from 1 to 3) and the other players do the same trying to find propositions which do suit the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot;'s personality. After this round the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot; takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Wahre Walter&amp;quot;s. Players do get points for every &amp;quot;Wahre Walter&amp;quot;, they noted and the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot; too gets points every time someone &amp;quot;bets&amp;quot; on his propositions, so the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot; has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully &amp;quot;faked&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;Sphinx&amp;quot;. So as said before, the players should known each other (despite the possibility to give &amp;quot;strangers&amp;quot;, some points of advance) and you need a lot of pieces of paper.","/boardgame/8939/der-wahre-walter"

To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.  At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &amp;ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.","/boardgame/8125/santiago"

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&amp;uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&amp;rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.  First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).  With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&amp;uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&amp;rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.","/boardgame/83667/first-train-nuremberg"

Humanity is on the brink of war as imperialist nations in the Far East and Europe work aggressively to expand their domination. The Nazis have taken control of Germany and now spread darkness across the globe in their hunt for powerful occult artifacts that can give them the upper hand in the days to come. But the spirit of adventure and freedom won't be stamped out so easily.  Heroic adventurers from around the world answer the call, racing against time to hunt down ancient artifacts, explore deadly temples, and fight back the powers of darkness from engulfing the world in flames. It is a race of good versus evil, and only a cunning and agile explorer can claim the ultimate prize of... Fortune and Glory!  Fortune and Glory: The Cliffhanger Game is a fast-paced game of high adventure, vile villains, edge-of-your-seat danger, and cliffhanger pulp movie action. Players take on the role of a treasure hunter, traveling the globe in search of ancient artifacts and fending off danger and villains at every turn in a quest for the ultimate reward of fortune and glory!  Featuring a beautifully rendered adventure map of the world as the game board, eight pulp adventure heroes to choose from (such as Jake Zane the Flying Ace, Li Mei Chen the Night Club Singer and Martial Artist, or Dr. Zhukov Master of Science), an army of ruthless villains and thugs (including the Chicago Mob and the dreaded occult-hunting Nazis), ancient Mayan temples to explore with a zeppelin hovering overhead, a wealth of coins to horde as heroes collect fortune and glory throughout the game, and a unique mechanism of dangers to overcome and the classic cliffhanger moments of suspense that can result. Fortune and Glory is designed to create a pulp serial cinematic feel as the story and game unfold.  So strap on your adventure boots and goggles, fire up the engines on the seaplane, and grab some extra ammo for your revolver...the Nazis already have a head start and in this race for fortune and glory, and there's no prize for second place!  Features:       Designed for strong Competitive and Cooperative play as players race against one another or work together to overcome a Vile Organization bent on world domination through powerful occult artifacts.

Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.&amp;nbsp;  K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.&amp;nbsp; You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers. K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike. The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).","/boardgame/73761/k2"

The goal is to lead the race around the castle wall, which is also the scoring track for the game. There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.  Play is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices. The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market). And, the player with the largest &amp;quot;keep&amp;quot; (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game.

This allows for the mixture of aerial and surface combat that characterized the Pacific theater of operations.  Players must write orders and assign missions to tasks forces prior to movement, then conduct aerial searches for enemy fleets and submarines.  Frequently, forces will clash in surface battles, and players track damage, hit by hit, reducing ship capabilities and inflicting casualties.

Within a day, one third of Spain was under the control of Nationalist forces attempting to stage a military coup. Over the next three years, what began as a military rebellion evolved into the physical battle lines of the much larger ideological conflict spreading across Europe between Fascism and Communism.  Popular Front recreates this conflict in 90-minute strategy game form, leading players to compete against their ideological counterparts not only for military positioning, but for political victory. Players must be concerned about the position of their forces on the board, but the composition of a player's hand will affect their success in combat more often than not. Plays with two, four, or six players split into two teams. Players each have an identical 20-card deck (with unique, original propaganda posters actually used in the war) that results in the use of your cards being more important than the luck of the draw.

In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents. These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film.  The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.

Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &amp;quot;counting offices&amp;quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is build on two core concepts:  1. Players bid for cards by building &amp;quot;towers&amp;quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &amp;quot;below&amp;quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.  2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &amp;quot;punishing&amp;quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.  The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.  ---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----  Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world. Within the harbour there stretches a unique complex of storehouses: Speicherstadt. The network of canals and bridges houses a terminal for spices, coffee, tea and carpets from all over the world.  As one of Hamburg&amp;acute;s wholesaler at the heyday of the Speicherstadt you acquire shiploads for the storehouses, not too expensive, of course, as you like to make a profit selling them. Who makes the best deals within a year and supplies his clients with the right goods will be the winner of the game. But beware! Sudden fires cause heavy losses. You might be advised to invest in fire protection early.  Playing Speicherstadt you will be thrilled by the simple and original mechanism of acquiring desired action cards.","/boardgame/66505/speicherstadt"

Twelve men: Trapped in the Antarctic  Eleven: Discover the intruder  Ten: Battle the alien force  Nine: Agonise for the answer  Eight: Desperate to be saved  Seven: Consumed one by one  Six... Five... Four... Three...  The Thing is an unauthorised non-collectable, non-profit game for two to six players, based on the 1982 horror movie masterpiece &amp;quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&amp;quot;, and simulates the paranoid members of an American Antarctic research facility (Outpost 31) being overrun by - or conquering - a parasitic alien organism capable of perfectly imitating its victims. One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.  The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.  The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.  During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....  Victory Conditions:  1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.       If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.      If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.     2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer. 3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed. 4. The Outpost #31 team win if the survivors manage to fly to the coast in the helicopter. 5. The Outpost #31 team win if they contact McMurdo base by radio.  Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.

But the 1859 war was different. The Piedmontese, the Italian province pressing the issue, had gotten Napoleon III and the French Army to help them. Garibaldi and his partisans were most effective in creating havoc. And the Austrians were woefully weak in high command ability and unit morale.  Risorgimento 1859 is a big game, yet easy to play. The battle games are very enjoyable with lots of maneuver and combat. The Campaign game uses a point-to-point map system. The focus is on coordination and concentration, the ability to guard avenues of approach, and the capability of units to engage in combat. Battles and Campaigns  Players fight the two major battles of the campaign, Magenta and Solferino (one of the largest battles in European history). The rules are relatively short and very accessible, as the battle system is designed for ease of play. For example, combat units do not have any numerical Strength! However, they do differ in Morale.  Magenta A wild battle fought in the vineyards, where no one could see anything. Reinforcements coming from all corners of the map, as the French have to cross a major river to take the important rail center.  Solferino The Austrians and the French literally stumble into each other in teh difficult and hilly country south of the Lombardian lakes. The battle that followed, pitting 4 French corps against 7 Austrian corps, was one of the most brutal in modern history. So brutal that it led directly to the founding of the Red Cross. The French, having started first, get to attack an Austrian-held position that takes advantage of every hill and valley.  The Campaign Play out the entire Campaign and see if you can avoid the mistakes the Austrians made.

On their turn, players play a card from their hand to an action space on the board.  These spaces allow players to acquire tower pieces, get money, build a portion of their towers, etc.  Once a card has been played in one of the action spaces on the board, all subsequent cards played in that area have to follow the original card&amp;rsquo;s color.

Scoring happens at the end of each round based on the number of towers a player has and the ornamentation present on those towers.

They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August. There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound. Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...  Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail.

Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition.  As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships.

Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.  Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.

The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.  Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.  The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.  Ways to Play: The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.  Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &amp;quot;The Duel of the Princes.&amp;quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.  As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.  Theme: The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &amp;quot;The Era of Gold,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Era of Turmoil,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Era of Progress.&amp;quot;  Belongs to the Catan Series.","/boardgame/66056/rivals-catan"

Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.  Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.  Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.  The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card.

From published material...  &amp;quot;Air Strike expands the proven and successful Air Superiority system to encompass air strikes against targets on the ground. New rules cover: Terrain-following flight, air-to-ground attacks (including strafing and bombing), antiaircraft artillery, and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Air Strike continues Air Superiority's easy-to-learn format. Rules are presented in a programmed structure, followed by scenarios demonstrating their use. Air Strike provides 32 new aircraft for the Air Superiority system, including: the Warthog (A-10s), F-1 5 Strike Eagle, Harrier II, Alpha Jet, SU-25, and MIG-27. Six new multi-color maps provide the varied and treacherous terrain over which players must find their targets. Included are 480 counters, representing everything from radar sites to the most modern air-defense missile and gun systems in service today. Trucks, tanks, infantry, and other targets are provided as well; but remember, on today's battlefield, what can be shot at can shoot back. Air Strike includes 25 scenarios suitable for solitaire, two-player, or multi-player play. Ranging from the Mideast to Germany, from Afghanistan to Africa, these scenarios provide players with a wide variety of complex and interesting situations. Several of these can be played both as solitaire and as multi-player simulations. The briefing booklet helps bring players up to date on the weapons and aircraft included in this game.

To this end, in addition to the counters provided for the historical game, counters for Norway and Sweden are supplied in compatible strengths for The Europa Series.  Narvik is a two player game. One side represents Norway and her Allies (Britain, France, and Poland), and the other represents Germany. The game is played in sequenced turns during which players move their units and engage in combat to destroy enemy units and gain geographic objectives. The German player will attempt to occupy Norway. The Norwegian player will attempt to prevent the occupation and/or extract the highest possible toll from the invaders.

Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card.

The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 3-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &amp;quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&amp;quot;  Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &amp;quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&amp;quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.  Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &amp;ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &amp;ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.  A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.  The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.","/boardgame/92319/olympos"

Be careful, some followers may turn against you, while others can slow you down. When it comes right down to it, the choice is simple: Run, Fight, or Die!

During this time Solomon instituted an unprecedented building program. As one of Solomon's chief governors, you must procure materials and oversee construction of buildings and roads across the land for the glory of Solomon. You will also help to construct the Temple, one of the wonders of the ancient world.  Kingdom of Solomon is a worker-placement game with a few new twists and turns. Do you claim a resource space, an action space or throw in all your remaining pawns to grab a powerful Bonus Space? Will you spend your resources to extend Solomon's kingdom, take some points in the Market or add to the Temple? These and many other choices await you in this highly interactive game.  You play Kingdom of Solomon in rounds of four phases.  You start the round placing your pawns to get resources, take actions or get a bonus.  In this placement phase players take turns, each placing one pawn at a time.  After all pawns have been placed, players resolve what they get from placing their pawns.  This is called the resolution phase, and each player, in turn, resolves the placement of all their pawns before the next player.  Next the players can go to the Market to sell or buy resources.  In this market phase, like the placement phase, players alternate taking turns, except that players take turns in reverse order.  The last shall be first, and the first shall be last.  Finally, you build in the building phase.  Players, one at a time, can build a building, roads and add blocks to the Temple.    When you place pawns to take actions, you can get an additional resource for a resource space, trade one resource for another, steal a resource from an opponent, get victory points or draw Fortune cards.  You can play Fortune cards at any time.  Fortune cards provide resources, victory points or special actions.  Bonuses your pawns can gain for you include one of every resource, three Fortune cards or victory points with a rearrangement of turn order so you become the new first player.  You use resources to build things.  Each thing costs a specific set of resources.  The buildings you build give you victory points and additional spots to place pawns for resources or actions.  Roads link resource spaces into resource regions so you can get more resources per pawn placed in the resource region.  Building Temple blocks give you either victory points or temple tokens that help you gain or keep the High Priest.  The High Priest lets you take advantage of another player&amp;rsquo;s resource region and gives you victory points at the end of the game.  The game ends at the end the round when a player places all his building tokens on building sites, there is a building token on each of the building sites, or the Temple is complete.  The player with the most victory points wins.","/boardgame/87821/kingdom-solomon"

The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side. This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.","/boardgame/85/quebec-1759"

The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship. Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil. Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name. Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement. To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.  The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans. Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.","/boardgame/82168/escape-aliens-outer-space"

Each of them have different demands the player must fulfill in order to give their best performance.  The requirements, which vary between performers, are Rehearsal, Equipment, Supplies, Costumes, and Promotion. There are three levels of performances that each performer can end up doing in a show: a poor one, a good one, and an outstanding one. The higher the level of performance, the more requirements each performer will have to fulfill in order to achieve it.  The better the performance, the more each player can get out of it. When performers do outstanding performances, the player must choose between getting the maximum amount of benefit out of them, or getting the Prestige Points they are offering.

Soon the precious discoveries will make their way abroad to public exhibitions before a waiting audience, eliciting substantial honor and glory.  The players attempt to gain federal research grants to cover the costs of their excavations through a bidding mechanism. Whoever is modest and less demanding can travel to the excavating areas before his or her competitors, and the rule is first come, first dig. Only fragments will remain for the later expeditions. Recovered treasures are placed in valuable exhibitions, for which the discoverer receives glory and recognition.  The player who accumulates the most glory after 12 rounds wins the game.

It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.  U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.  A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.  When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.  U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats:  Type IIB/C coastal submarines  Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines Type XXI Elektro-boat  U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:  The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.  The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.  Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.  The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.  -Dan Verssen Games  Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen","/boardgame/85108/u-boat-leader"

The game places the player in the role of the patrol&amp;rsquo;s leader. It allows the player to experience some of the decisions that face a Ranger patrol leader.  From the Designer's Notes: &amp;quot;In designing Ranger, I have attempted to do two things. First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&amp;quot;  Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.","/boardgame/6929/ranger"

C'mon in and sit a spell. Let me tell ya about Jack Colty and his gang, and get ya up to gallop on all the interestin' events. Those filthy drovers and gunslingers are dangerous and desperate, each one generally havin' killed a man, and be content to live on a diet of Navy plug and whiskey. I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after hearin' this here stupefyin' story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess you folks can make up yer own minds why I retired early.  The year is 1892. The bank at Repentance Springs has been robbed. Many good citizens, including Sheriff Anton Dreyfus and school-marm Sue Daggett, were brutally slain as Colty's gang shot its way, whooping and hollering, out of town. Colonel Ned McReady and his men are tasked with bringing Jack Colty - a man so mean he'd steal a fly from a blind spider, or a coin off a dead man's eyes - and his gang to justice.  Revolver is a non-collectable card game set in the Old West.  Consisting of two balanced 62 card decks, the game pits two players against each other in a life or death struggle. One player takes the role of Colonel Ned McReady and his lawmen, and his opponent assumes control of the notorious and deadly Colty gang.  At their disposal, the Colty gang - the meanest bunch of low down dirty dogs in the West - have a roster of weaponry to bring down the lawmen on their tail: .38 Specials, .45 Long Colts, 1866 double barrel Derringers, and even a Gatling gun! Some example cards from the gang's deck: Cherokee Scout, &amp;quot;Adios, Amigoes!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Thanks for yer coffee and eggs, ma'am&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Chew on this, Gringo!&amp;quot;  The Colonel player's objective is to eliminate all the gang members before they can escape across the Mexican border. He can utilise such cards as Buffalo Stampede, Rattlesnake Bite, &amp;quot;I can smell those yellow bellies on the wind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;He shot my hat clean off!&amp;quot; Apache Scout, and Rickety Bridge.  The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Revolver is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive gunfights in the following battlegrounds: The Bank at Repentance Springs, Whiskey Canyon, Buzzard Point, Rattlesnake Creek, and the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with bandits gunned down frequently, and law-men peppered with lead by the well-placed use of &amp;quot;Fire at will, boys.&amp;quot;  Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colty player could choose to deploy the Jackson Clan during the Whiskey Canyon battle, but the resources that this would require might make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Colonel McReady player can deploy the Colonel at any time during the conflict - he's free to play aboard the 3:15 Express Train, but hugely expensive if used at Buzzard Point, for instance. Also, during the final confrontation, Jack Colty can force the train to crash - as a last ditch effort, probably killing some of his own crew in the process - he's as crazy as popcorn on a hot stove!  Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. Some simple icons are used to display such things as 'coming-into-play' effects, and if a gringo has 'True Grit'.  Revolver can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, and is a new implementation of Aliens: This Time It's War.  Victory Conditions:  The Colty Gang player wins if he manages to &amp;quot;Escape across the Mexican border.&amp;quot; The Colty Gang player wins if he reaches and survives the battle on the 3:15 Express train. The Colonel McReady player wins if Jack Colty and all the gang members are either hanged or killed. The Colonel McReady player wins if Cortez is killed before boarding the 3:15 Express train.  Each bandit character card has a Survival Rating, indicating the likelihood of them surviving to the end of the game. For example, Lenny and Micky Mason have a low chance of survival, whereas Cortez has a high Survival Rating. Also, certain character's deaths have hugely detrimental effects on the game, such as having to discard a card, or in &amp;quot;Kittens&amp;quot; Mackenzie's case: the gang having to fight an extra two turns on the Rattlesnake Creek battlefield.","/boardgame/76150/revolver"

Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.  Fifth Corps uses a collection of mechanics, including &amp;quot;Operations Points&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Friction Points&amp;quot;, variable length game turns, and Zones of Control to simulate modern battlefield conditions. As with most modern warfare games, Fifth Corps includes rules for airpower, airmobile operations, and nuclear/chemical warfare. The game includes three scenarios: an introductory &amp;quot;Rhein-Main Raid&amp;quot;, a more advanced &amp;quot;The Battle for Fulda&amp;quot;, and the campaign game, &amp;quot;Fifth Corps&amp;quot;.       The Rhein-Main Raid Scenario: Three days after the next war began, the Soviets had not crossed into the Fulda/Frankfurt area. All Warsaw Pact lines of advance had been to the north and south of Fifth Corp's area of operations.Thus, NATO vacated the area to reinforce other hard hit sectors. NATO was surprised then, when two Soviet motorized rifle divisions entered the Fulda Gap supported by attack helicopters, aiming to seize a NATO nuclear site at Giessen, the Wiesbaden Airfield, and the critical Rhein-Main Airbase... A mobile, confusing engagement ensured, independent of the major battles along the rest of the front.        The Battle for Fulda Scenario: At the outbreak of the next war, few areas were harder hit than the Fulda Gap. Here an entire Soviet Army and various support units, including an airborne regiment, were committed on the first day... Those [NATO support units] that survived were ordered to &amp;quot;contain all enemy breakouts&amp;quot; until the arrival of the 5th Panzer Division.

Players try to contribute the most to the land of Zarahemla by building settlements, cities, roads, and helping construct the temple. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, water, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 12 victory points and win the game.  Game play is similar to Settlers of Catan, but players can add a stone to the temple by paying one brick and one stone.  The player who contributes the most stones gains 2 extra victory points.  A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone collecting any resource cards based on the roll and position of settlements (or upgraded cities) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.  Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), from having made the biggest contribution to building the Zarahemla temple, and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 12 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.  Rather than having individual hexes like Catan the game has five separate strips of hexes. These are double sided so it is still possible to construct different board configurations.  Expanded by:  The Settlers of Zarahemla Mini-Expansion (2003)  Belongs to the Catan Series.","/boardgame/6778/settlers-zarahemla"

Khmer, is a bluffing and deduction game for two players that contains only sixteen cards, with each player trying to figure out the best time to end the round so that they can win. The goal each round is to have a hand of cards with a higher sum than the opponent, but equal to or less than the sum played to the table.  To set up a round, deal six cards face down to each player, then remove the remaining four cards, unseen, from the game. On your turn, you take one of these five actions:  1: PLAY a card from your hand to the table, overlapping any cards previously played and announcing the sum of all revealed cards.  2: DRAW the most recently played card from the table and place it in front of you; this card counts as being in your hand, thereby increasing the sum of your hand and lowering the sum on the table, but you cannot discard or play this card.  3: DISCARD a 6 card from your hand, placing it to the side out of play for this round.  4: KNOCK to end the round and see who wins; you may do this only if the sum of cards in your hand is equal to or less than the sum on the table. The players then compare sums, and whoever has the highest sum (without going over the sum of cards on the table) wins 2 points; if the players are tied, the player who knocked loses.  5: FOLD to end the round because you think that you will lose; the opponent wins 1 point.  Shuffle all the cards, and redeal; the player who scored in the round starts the next round, and the first player to collect 6 points wins. Alternatively, players can play only a single round to determine the winner, ignoring the FOLD action since that's a sure loser...","/boardgame/73313/elements"

For the faithful, they instill horror. For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity!  In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?  Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!  So much to forgive, so little time.

If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.  It's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips.

If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.  There's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each worth -1 for him at the end of the hand.

This rumor rekindles their passion for Tikal and the two scientists start to discuss the prospect of another expedition to Central America. In the midst of their planning they encounter Profs. Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumour.  Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire after a fine meal finished off with Cuban cigars and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamour their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.  An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site. Not too long after, they discover that there is indeed an undisturbed temple in an adjacent valley. As it belonged to a long-forgotten king, the temple promises many surprises and much, much gold. And so the adventure begins...   Tikal II: The Lost Temple is a sequel to 1999 Spiel des Jahres winner Tikal, from world-famous duo Kramer-Kiesling.  Actions points have given way to two actions per turn : 1) move part of your expedition around the board to choose an action tile, and then 2) move your head scientist within the temple to explore new rooms and find gold.  There are many ways to score. Collecting and delivering treasures is one, and having the majority in some rooms or exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber, are others.  Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can't move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce. A game consists of two rounds, each concluded by a scoring. In the end, the player with the most gold is declared winner.","/boardgame/67180/tikal-ii-lost-temple"

Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &amp;ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.  The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:       Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.     Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.     Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.     Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.   Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.  In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.  Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.","/boardgame/97903/terror-meeple-city"

The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.  Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &amp;quot;shadow&amp;quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.  Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.  The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &amp;quot;breaking out&amp;quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.  The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.  Second edition changes included:       the square grid on the original map was replaced with a  hexagonal brick grid overlay;        the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships;       the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by much more complex rules. (Indeed, many considered the rules changes ponderous and detrimental to gameplay.)      packaging was modified, second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.","/boardgame/76436/bismarck-second-edition"

The old crown fell, and many stepped forward to claim it. That was two centuries ago.  Now the barons and the princes swear loyalty to whichever claimant-emperor garrisons the nearest army today. The clergy sell their sermons for the highest bidder, and spies whisper promises to mercenary generals.  You are the one true ruler of the broken Empire of Lyssan, and it's up to you to put the pretenders (the other players) in their place before their endless squabbling tears your nation apart. You (and others) will attempt to take control by using castles, knights, nobles, priests, and spies:       Knights hold territory and fight masterfully.     Nobles hold territory, support priests, and fight poorly.     Castles hold territory, spawn new units, and protect knights and nobles.     Priests manipulate influence and support spies.     Spies assassinate priests and other spies, and have the devastating power to steal other players' court cards.   Lyssan is an intense board game of strategy, cooperation, and betrayal for two to four players. The winner is the player who claims the most trophies, and each trophy can only be claimed by a single player. One trophy card might call for the player to control the most mines, the next to have most spies deployed, and the next to have the most sophisticated court. An upcoming trophy is revealed each turn, requiring strength, cunning, and adaptability to win.  Lyssan combines tightly designed euro-style rules with the interactivity and flavor of an epic wargame. Lyssan has slim rules comparable to many family friendly games. Yet the play is as rich and interactive as the crunchiest, most grognard-friendly wargames. And Lyssan plays fast. A typical game of Lyssan runs a full hour quicker than comparable games.  Lyssan combines:  A map to be conquered (like Risk)...  ...with a few different unit types that act a few different ways each (like Chess or Diplomacy) ...  ...with cards that let players pull off devastating surprise moves or permanently improve their abilities. To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands. Get one of your spies into a rival's castle, and you can take over his improvements or turn his own followers against him.  All interrupting effects have been stripped out of the game, so each player can complete their turn quickly, without waiting for the others. The game has been designed from the start to allow timed play, like a tournament chess match. This is good for players who want extra-brisk play, or who just have one slowpoke at the table who needs to be reined in.","/boardgame/97939/lyssan"

The game uses the in-game deck-building mechanism from Dominion &amp;ndash; that is, each player starts with a small deck of resource cards and during the course of the game one buys cards from an open card pool to build a deck of cards to play with. Goal of the game is to conquer Moscow. If Moscow falls the player with the most victory points wins. Victory points are acquired by conquering different cities and/or strategical positions during the game. Every time you attack a city, event cards from an event deck are drawn (e.g. General &amp;quot;Winter&amp;quot;). Barbarossa uses six different kinds of cards:       Supply Cards: These provide points to buy other cards from the open card pool.         Unit Cards: The use of these cards require &amp;quot;Operation Points&amp;quot; (Each turn you start with one Operation Point) and deliver the military strength to attack cities or strategic positions (or in other words gain victory point cards).        Operation Cards: They give you a one time bonus in different forms. After use they are not just discarded but put out of play.        Deploy Cards: They stay in the players play area and deliver bonuses in different forms every turn.        Target Cards: The cities and strategic positions which deliver VPs, also if you conquered strategic positions it becomes easier to attack cities.

Airplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control. Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of &amp;quot;Fire&amp;quot; card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.

For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.  Wings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection. It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane. Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers.

The players find out which kind of walls are in certain directions by pressing one of four &amp;quot;arrow buttons&amp;quot; of a &amp;quot;compass&amp;quot; device with a built-in AI (to ensure that each game will have a different house). Walls come in four types: One that allows all animals to pass through, one with a mousehole that allows only mice through, one with a hole in the top that only hares can jump through, and one that's solid and impassable. The players build those walls, creating step-by-step a 3D-labyrinth. The goal of this first phase is to find the &amp;quot;magic doors&amp;quot;, which can be opened only if there is an animal on each side.  Once the players find the magic doors, the ghost &amp;quot;Hubi&amp;quot; appears. The device gives hints to the players, allowing them to deduce where Hubi is so that ideally they can eventually chase it out of the house.  Schnappt Hubi! includes three difficulty levels, with a &amp;quot;timer&amp;quot; running in the hardest level that ends the game after a certain number of moves.","/boardgame/92644/schnappt-hubi"

All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.  Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours.

The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!  Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).  Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.  Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).  The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.  All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like &amp;quot;do you develop your grain productivity &amp;ndash; thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it &amp;ndash; or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?&amp;quot;, adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).  When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).  Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.","/boardgame/73070/olympus"

Additional information may include special abilities / actions / attacks and potions.  The game is played on modular dungeon boards. During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks.

Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.  Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&amp;rsquo;s train reaches the last track.  To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?  The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &amp;ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.  Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.  Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.","/boardgame/93724/black-gold"

In this game, each player assumes the role of a nondescript colonial power. Players proceed to struggle for influence in the unindustrialized regions of the world, and the subsequent resources such influence entails.  Each turn is divided into action phases and colonization phases. During action phases, players use cards to secretly bid influence in the six regions of the game board. During colonization phases, all cards in play are revealed, the placement of influence is resolved, and conflict occurs.  Whenever all native influence is eliminated from a region, that region's resources are collected. The amount of resources collected by each player depends on each players' influence in the region. At the end of the game, the player who collects the most resources wins.","/boardgame/67917/colonialism"

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&amp;rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!  Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.  Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.  Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.  While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?","/boardgame/94362/rune-age"

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?  				 				 					How to Play  You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish.  The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.  				 				 					Design Notes  Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence.  The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion.  During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last.  Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage.  Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.","/boardgame/67888/lords-scotland"

To take control of a village, the students must come together in uncomfortable alliances, regardless of their tribal origin. Eventually students become Masters themselves, train new students and expand to other villages.  There is one thing each student must keep in mind as they travel from village to village -- the mystical powers of Shangri-La mysteriously cause the bridges to collapse, separating villages forever. One crucial question will decide the winner: who will control the most Masters of Shangri-La?  Players take on the roles of leaders of a specific tribe. There is a battle raging over the empty villages of the land and players must quickly fill those villages with their tribal leaders. As players migrate tribal leaders from one village to the next, they must not become too weak or they risk losing leaders to opposing tribes.

The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed.

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Eastern Virginia and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Sam Grant so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&amp;rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.  All artwork and graphics in the game Bobby Lee was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz.","/boardgame/82/bobby-lee"

They must conjure the mysterious powers of Quiddity, cast powerful spells, and summon their creatures to battle if they hope to overcome rivals and earn their rightful place as the Champion!  Quarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added &amp;lsquo;deckbuilding&amp;rsquo; twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.  Quarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling.  Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&amp;rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.  Alternate Description of Quarriors  In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &amp;quot;the Wilds&amp;quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.  Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!","/boardgame/91536/quarriors"

Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game where the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power. The game is played on a number of boards: the Master board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits, and a number of scenario boards which detail the events and adventures of particular locations. Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die. The game is lost if the ring-bearer is overcome by Sauron, or won if the ring is destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.

With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.  Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!  This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.","/boardgame/99078/divided-republic"

If the beam strikes a non-mirrored surface on almost any piece, that piece is removed from play. (One exception: The defenders have one surface immune from laser fire, which means you can use them to protect your king; they're vulnerable to laser fire from other directions, though.)

This is a fast network-/portfolio-building game with a train theme, with the objective of having the most valuable stock portfolio at the end of the game.  Players can own and trade stocks as well as influence the value of each company.  There are 6 colors of wooden locomotives, each color representing a company.  Players are dealt random hands of 5-10 (depending on number of players) locomotives, which are essentially a stock portfolio; the rest of each color are placed in a pool.  On your turn, you can either increase the value of a single company by placing 1-5 locomotives from the remaining pool of that company, or you can trade one locomotive in your portfolio for one or two locomotives from the remaining pool in a company.  The game board is a map of France, with cities worth anywhere from 1-4 points, and rural hexes worth 0.  Connecting to a city adds to a company's value.  The game ends when Marseille is reached by a company, or when there is only one company with locomotives remaining in the pool.  Players' scores are determined by the value of each company at the end multiplied by the number of locomotives the player has for each color.  SNCF expansions may be used with this game.","/boardgame/75358/paris-connection"

The game puts one to four players in the role of a unique character in charge of a small territory in the old west. Some examples of the characters in the game are Banker, Cowboy, and Tracker. The characters have various abilities that give them advantages in the game as well as a starting bonus of some sort. Each player collects and uses various resources to build towns, cities, and rails to grow their territories. Players start the game with one city and two towns with the goal of growing out their territories to include additional towns, cities, and railroad connections throughout the areas that they control. The objective of the game is to collect the most victory points when the game ends. Players do this by expanding their territory, collecting gold, and obtaining Influence Points from certain actions on the game board. Players will need to watch each other&amp;rsquo;s progress as the game can end in several different ways.  Summary of Play Each turn players roll two colored dice and place those dice on a specific action on the game board. The game has built in actions and tokens that allow players to manipulate their dice in certain ways. So players will have to decide whether to use these actions or limited tokens such as the Wild Die tokens to modify their dice. This allows players to use a majority of the dice rolls that come up each turn to further improve their position in the game.  The game promotes fast play as each player takes turns placing one or more dice on only one action per turn. Actions can include but are not limited to drawing cards, collecting resources, building additional towns and cities, and taking special actions such as the Sheriff, Mayor, Trader, or Tycoon. Some actions, such as Rail Baron, require a certain natural die roll while other actions require that your dice add up to a certain value. Players gain influence points during the game by taking specific actions which counts for a players overall victory points needed at the end of the game. Players will also need to focus on building their railroad connections as efficiently as they can to maximize their score at the end of the game.","/boardgame/98443/dark-horse"

If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.  The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play.

It is a world inhabited by Cyrano, Roxanne, Scaranouche, Errol Flynn, Porthos, Athos, Aramis, Rhonda Fleming, Francois Villon, Constance, and, of course, D'Artagnan. There are people to be used, friends in high places to be cultivated, enemies to be humiliated, the Cardinal's Guard to be trounced, lackies to be abused, the hand of a fair damsel to be won, and the ear of the King to be gained.

Each player has three rule cards, and at the start of a round, each player plays one of these cards. The rule cards played determine the rules for that round.

The winner of a trick leads the next trick. At the end of the round each trick is worth one point, modified by the scoring cards.

The board game Kolejka (a.k.a. Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty.  The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. Tension mounts as the product delivery cards are uncovered and it turns out that there will be enough product cards only for the lucky few standing closest to the door of a store. Since everyone wants to be first, the queue starts to push up against the door. To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as &amp;quot;Mother carrying small child&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;This is not your place, sir&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Under-the-counter goods&amp;quot;. But they have to watch out for &amp;quot;Closed for stocktaking&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Delivery error&amp;quot;, and for the black pawns &amp;ndash; the speculators &amp;ndash; standing in the queue. Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags.  On the product cards are photos of sixty original objects from the Communist era. The merchandise includes Relaks shoes, Przemysławka eau de cologne, and Popularna tea, as well as other commodities that were once in scarce supply. The neighborhood also has an outdoor market but the prices there are steep &amp;ndash; unless, of course, you manage to strike a deal with the market trader.

Players start the game by managing their corporations (1 of 4) and using them as a tool for increasing the value of private property (like countries in &amp;quot;Imperial&amp;quot;). By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential. The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.  THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR. Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.  Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&amp;rsquo; plans. Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.  Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.  The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &amp;quot;Imperial&amp;quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.  There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.  Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.  There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.","/boardgame/75441/master-economy"

Two special forces camps, a handful of elite soldiers, and thirty miles of rugged, jungled terrain were all that stood between the onrushing NVA and their objective, the strategic town of Pleiku. The NVA quickly surrounded and besieged the camps, threatening a quick and easy victory over the outnumbered II Corps defenders. Desperate to hold back the tide of Communist soldiers, the South Vietnamese commander asked the U.S. for help.  The newly formed 1st Cavalry Division, fresh in country and bivouacked at nearby An Khe, rushed to the aid of the beleaguered garrisons. With its complement of over 400 combat helicopters, the 1st Cav was completely airmobile. While the helicopter's mobility guaranteed quick movement and ready resupply, it did not guarantee victory. The soldiers that the unblooded Americans faced were tough, well trained veterans. Victory would not come easily for the Americans.  Between October 23 and November 25, 1965, a desperate struggle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division took place west of Pleiku in Vietnam's Central Highlands.

Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.  It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons. Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.  The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.  Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.  				 				 					Rules overview from the official rules:  The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.  Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight. During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas. Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&amp;rsquo;s power, and so on. &amp;ndash; If a player is unable to do this, he must retreat from the fight.  A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.  Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals). A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.  				 				 					Description from the publisher.  The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.  Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.","/boardgame/9446/blue-moon"

Hard decisions include whether to play safely to keep ships afloat or take potentially profitable risks.  The crux of the play is hinged upon whether to bring in vital war goods, which reduce the intensity of the growing blockade, or more profitable black market goods.

Each family has several eligible roosters eager to jump into the world of politics, getting rich and creating a legacy by any means necessary.  Roosters gain renown for their families by occupying various political offices. Low-ranking officers don't yield much fame, but they hold both the purse strings and the power of the sword. A few roosters in the lower offices of Aedile and Praetor, together with the votes of a few well-paid (and temporary) allies, can clear a path to the luxury and recognition that come with the titles of Censor, Consul, and even Caesar.  Being Caesar isn't easy, though: fail to bribe and bargain to ensure the welfare of the whole coop and today's Caesar is tomorrow's Coq au Vin. Dead roosters don't earn any more points, but they do offer opportunities for their surviving relatives to exaggerate their accomplishments. All that matters, in the end, is history's judgment, and history can be rewritten.  Mechanically, players gain and maintain areas of influence through negotiation and voting. The game features a Suffragium marker that players pass after voting to either promote a Rooster to a higher office, or throw him to the fox. Players can also strategically demand bribes for their votes or even refuse to vote (pass) to gain a later advantage.  Murder, betrayal, votes for cash, fragile alliances, and bloody vendettas will separate the legendary families from the forgotten ones in the struggle to become &amp;ndash; and remain &amp;ndash; Chicken Caesar!","/boardgame/88513/chicken-caesar"

America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.  Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction.

The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely.

Players have two movement points per turn and are only allowed to move to untaken tiles. When a player leaves a tile he gets to take it and place it in front of him. Food and artifacts are kept face down, but weapons and mammoths are kept face up. Whoever hunts down the biggest mammoth in the summer phase will start the winter phase.  Players also have to visit the four winter camps during the summer to store supplies for the upcoming winter. If a player is not able to visit all four camps during summer, he will have fewer hunters in the winter phase.  There are a lot of different tiles: - Food tiles score 1 to 3 points at the end of the game, depending on the type of food. - Rare and valuable artifact tiles increase in value depending on the number of identical tiles you collected. - Weapons are used to hunt down mighty mammoths. - Path-tiles remain on the board and guarantee a minimum amount of maneuverability. - Caves are connected with each other and may be used to cover big distances while moving.

Facing them on the beaches and in the hedgerows are some of the finest, and worst, formations in the German Army. Except for the near disaster on Omaha Beach, the landings go well.  Both sides begin the race to build up, and the Allies, with total command of the seas and skies, begin to pull ahead of the Germans as the month of June wears on. The Allies are under intense pressure to advance quickly, and not just for purely military reasons. Progress, however, is painfully slow. The British Second Army, scheduled to take Caen on D-Day, is held up short of that objective with heavy losses for the entire month by fanatical and skillful German resistance. The Americans face weaker opposition, and despite taking the port of Cherbourg, they become bogged down in the endless maze of hedgerows.

An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.  Odds on each horse are pre-set and depend largely on the number patterns described above.

In this game mode, if the Human Alliance achieves victory, all players win. Otherwise, everyone loses.  -Advanced game mode, is a semi-competitive game for 2-4 players, where each player forming the human Alliance has his own secret agenda and is able to obtain individualized victory points.

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.  To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.  When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!","/boardgame/826/cartagena"

The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hittites, Persians, and Assyrians.  Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.  A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.  Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent [i]does have[/i] more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).","/boardgame/986/babel"

However, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive at an oasis, and night falls, thieves attack the caravan and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the nature of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, only one player receives three of the total five clues. From the actions of the other players (caravan leaders), the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.  The next morning, the caravan continues it's way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

A campaign scenario linking all three (9~14 Feb) battles from the beginning to the end can be completed in less than 3 hours.  The French moves first in all scenarios.

The Lion Clan marshals its forces at the Plains of Thunder, determined to exact revenge against the scheming Scorpion Clan. The Dragon Clan attempts to reconcile the two armies, even as it refuses to reveal evidence that might exonerate the Lion, and incriminate the Scorpion. And the Phoenix Clan races to intervene before the situation becomes a War of Honor to turn the Empire against itself.  In this exciting new multiplayer format for the Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game, you will form and dissolve alliances, engage in political maneuverings, and wage mighty battles to determine which Clan will triumph.  &amp;middot; Features a deck for each of the four following Clans: Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, and Scorpion. &amp;middot; Includes a scoring board, markers, and movable tiles that give a different game play experience every time. &amp;middot; Also included: tiles for each of the other five Great Clans, making War of Honor fully expandable with your existing Legend of the Five Rings cards. &amp;middot; The basic game is for 2-4 players, but can be played with more if customized using your own L5R cards.

In each game, the group must go through 14 of the 56 available dungeon rooms in order to defeat the powerful sorcerer Zangdar. In every room, players will face choices, skill checks or battles, and maybe rewards (as xp, gold or loot cards)  There're 8 kind of skill checks, and each checks can slightly differ from the others of the same kind (number of players involved, special rule, etc.). Most of the skill checks use Destiny Tiles (which are 16 thick cards, which also represents monsters) and a special timer (with 3 difficulty levels)       Balance Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, walk/run around and sit down again without letting the tile fall.      Climbing Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the top of his head, stand up on his chair, then sit down again without letting the tile fall.      Dexterity Check: the player must build a house of cards using Destiny Tiles.      Speed Check: the player must put a Destiny Tile on the edge of the table, then slap it up the air and catch it before it falls back down.      Precision Check: a player stands 3 steps from the table, holding the game box, and the others must throw Destiny Tiles into the box from the other side of the table.      Intelligence Check: players play a memory game with the 16 Destiny Tiles      Coordination Check: players stands a step from the table, and must circle all the Destiny Tiles around the table, throwing them from one player to the next.      Stamina Check: the player must stand on one leg, with a Destiny Tile on his other knee and another one on both of his forefingers, without dropping down either one.     The battles are also timed and are played with Letter Cards, that can be exchanged one by one between 2 players. They are used to spell special words (several different words for each character) as blows to the enemy. Every time a player plays cards to spell a word, he draw 3 new cards and keep on playing. At the end of the battle, if there're enough blows, the enemy is defeated. For instance, the sorceress can cast a spell by spelling &amp;quot;wazaaa&amp;quot; with any number of a's at the end, wounding the enemy for every extra a's. The barbarian can misspell a letter in each of his word. The bard and the ranger can make other players draw cards. And so on&amp;hellip; For every 3 cards played with a punch symbol on it, a player takes one wound him/herself.  Using gold and/or xp, characters can level up (up to level 3) and gain access to more powerful attacks or skills. The party can rest up to 3 times a game to recover from one wound each. If a player dies, he shuffles his character sheet with the other available sheets and pick one : if it's the same, he  recovers all his health and keep all his loot, gold and xp; if it's another one, he dies, loses everything, and continues the game as a totally new character.  If the players defeat Zangdar the Sorcerer in the 14th room (4 tiles with different rules so every game doesn't end the same way), they win the game.","/boardgame/66125/le-donjon-de-naheulbeuk"

It was created in collaboration between Akira Itō (Yu-Gi-Oh! R), Satoshi Nakamura (Duel Masters), and Bushiroad president Takaaki Kidani. The game was also released in conjunction with a TV anime series, &amp;quot;カードファイト!! ヴァンガード&amp;quot; (Cardfight!! Vanguard).  In the game, players &amp;quot;ride&amp;quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.  As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &amp;quot;drive check&amp;quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &amp;quot;damage check&amp;quot;.  At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &amp;quot;vanguard circle&amp;quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &amp;quot;drive check&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;damage check&amp;quot;.  Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:  1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard) 2. Stand and Draw 3. Ride 4. Call 5. Attack 6. Guard 7. Drive Check 8. Damage Check 9. (more attacks? Go back to 5) 10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2  It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &amp;quot;counter blast&amp;quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).","/boardgame/96765/cardfight-vanguard"

In the advanced rules, it is possible to legally &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot;. If you play more than three cards, you can build more huts. If you play less than three cards, you can build more easily &amp;mdash; but to prevent some excess, there can be only one denunciation every turn, and you can only denounce another player if you cheat &amp;quot;less&amp;quot; than your opponent!","/boardgame/8147/maka-bana"

If that wasn't enough to worry about, our neighbors are also preparing for war and petitioning the king for his troops and supplies which are already spread thin. It seems you'll not only be fighting a war of steel, but one of words as well.  In Dragon Valley, players take turns dividing items such as knights and archers, building materials for blacksmith shops and towers, special powers and even attackers. The attackers consist of dragons, orcs and battering rams that emerge from mountain passes into each player's lands. After dividing, other players select the group of items they prefer and leave the remainder with the player who did the dividing. After that, players use special cards to interfere with each others plans.

Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of courageous (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon&amp;rsquo;s lair...  Legends say that the doors of Dragonfire Dungeon open every sunrise, welcoming brave adventurers into its depths. But once the sun sets, the doors close and seal the fates of those who lingered too long. Only a few have ever returned from Dragonfire Dungeon, and those who have usually come back near death. But they return as heroes nonetheless.  In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...  While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, DungeonQuest is unique in that the dungeon essentially runs itself. No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time. Additionally, DungeonQuest also includes rules for solo play, so you can even challenge Kalladra&amp;rsquo;s keep on your own!  Great riches and everlasting glory await if you can survive Dragonfire Dungeon. The Dragonlord Kalladra has challenged all heroes of Terrinoth to test themselves against the most dangerous dungeon in all the realms.  Dare you face the dragon&amp;rsquo;s challenge?","/boardgame/71061/dungeonquest-third-edition"

In Kings &amp;amp; Castles the players take the part of these men as they pursue their ambitions at home and abroad. The treatment is broad-brush and fairly abstract: there is a map and the counters carry pictures of castles and soldiers, but you don't have to start worrying about dice and combat results; this is not a wargame.  Players take turns to conquer as many regions as possible with their own and opponents forces - an intriguing mechanic - then decide whether to tax the hard working peasants or not.

Guadalcanal introduces several types of Marine units: Marine rifle, parachute and Raider units plus scouts. The Marines usually have very good morale, and have excellent leadership and strong firepower. Where they&amp;rsquo;re at time lacking is in support weapons: The Army gets first call on tanks and artillery, and the Marine versions on Guadalcanal are not up to the high quality of the riflemen.  Japan counters with Army and navy units of low firepower but fanatically high morale. Japanese artillery isn&amp;rsquo;t very good, their handful of tanks will barely keep out rifle bullets, and there are few direct support weapons. The key to Japanese success will be to enter close combat with the Marines, where the Japanese warrior spirit can be used to full advantage.  Scenarios cover a wide variety of actions.

In 1895, exploring Amazonia, Auguste Copperpot discovered a gate to a lost valley, occupied by a primitive civilisation. Wiraqocha Valley was the name he gave to this remote Eden. This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists. Empress Victoria II decided to send several conglomerates to share this promised land and reap the fruits to her benefit. Zeppelin fleet, full of scientists, adventurers and looters, clouded the Atlantic sky.  Wiraqocha Valley is represented by an adjustable board consisting of 22 hexagonal tiles, each of them being identified by a number from 1 to 12, or a dice combo (pairs or straights). In his turn, each player rolls some six-sided dice, combining them to take possession of territories, or to protect from the opponents the ones he already owns. Every hexagon affords resources or special capacities, which are means to influence die results to fit one&amp;rsquo;s strategy. There are three ways to win: bring back a huge cargo of Somnium to the Empress; acquire enough scientific knowledge to build the Leviathan, a terrifying weapon serving the Kingdom; or find in the temple depths the four relics that will allow you to reach Wiraqocha&amp;rsquo;s treasure.","/boardgame/97875/wiraqocha"

TwixT is a &amp;quot;connection-type&amp;quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &amp;quot;Connection type&amp;quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.  Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.  Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.  After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.  On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.  When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.","/boardgame/949/twixt"

The game is scenario driven and each scenario defines the goal of the game as well as the initial setup of the starfield hex board. Each turn, players have a certain number of energy points that can be spent to perform actions such as movement or firing. Combat is resolved by rolling special dice: a 10-sided die with letters and an eight-sided die with numbers. The resulting letter-number combination is compared to the target ship&amp;rsquo;s reference card to determine the result.

However, when collecting income you draw cards from 4 different mines (card stacks) with each having its own distribution! The number of gems you earn depends on the upgrade level of your dwarves. Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.  On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.  With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.  The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.  Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.  The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.  The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.  Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.  Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.  The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.  Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.","/boardgame/9220/saboteur"

(A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.  Dia De Los Muertos (Days Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.  The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, can figure out what you partner signals when they swap a card, can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Loa Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. Rather brain-bending it is.  The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.  Not to be confused with:       Dia de los Muertos (2007)","/boardgame/950/four-dragons"

GOSU plays like a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering with each player trying to recruit an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes &amp;ndash; then swing it into action against the other players. Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.  Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards, or pass. To activate a goblin or draw cards, players need to spend 1-2 activation tokens, with them having only two at the start of each battle. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.  Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles. The first player to win three battles wins the game.  Reimplemented as:      GOSU 2: Tactics","/boardgame/66587/gosu"

When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!  Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.  Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.  Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.  Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs is the second game in the series of &amp;quot;Pocket Battles&amp;quot;, after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.  The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.  The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).  On your turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on your unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).  After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.  When one army has eliminated half of the other's original deployment value, that battle round concludes the game, and the player who has defeated the greatest total point-value of opposing units is the winner.","/boardgame/66081/pocket-battles-elves-vs-orcs"

The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points.

At the start of a round, the dealer randomly draws one special card, reads it to all the players, shuffles it into the deck, then deals the deck out evenly to all players. (The dealer for the first round is the game's owner; for subsequent rounds, the dealer is the one who took the 5 of Dwarves in the previous round.) The player who receives the 5 of Knights draws a contract tile, reads it, then chooses one of the two scoring rules on it to apply for that round.  The player holding the 5 of Goblins leads on the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible, and the game includes no trump. The highest card played of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick.

However, hope is not lost, a mystical portal of 10 components can be built and save the island and all its inhabitants, but fail to build it in time and the island will sink forever under the waves, lost to legend.  Atlantis Rising is a fully co-operative game in which the players must race to create a cosmic gate before all of the island tiles have been destroyed. The gate's components are variable and determine the difficulty level of the game - Easy, Normal, Hard, or Cosmic. The players must also contend with the continually escalating threat of their Athenian enemies, who may destroy one or more island tiles each turn if insufficient Atlanteans are allocated to the island's protection.  Each turn players can choose to place their Atlanteans in any of eight different areas - with placements closer to the sea being more rewarding, but subject to a higher risk of flooding (and the subsequent loss of the associated action).  After placement of meeple but before gaining resources 'misfortune' cards are drawn per player indicating which areas of the island sink, any meeple stood there have a long swim back to shore and do nothing for their turn.  Players have limited 'mystical energy' which they can use to predict or prevent certain misfortunes and cards are available from the libraries that offer powerful one time use effects.   From the back of the box:  Will you send your Atlanteans to mine the untapped veins of precious resources at the very tip of the island, hoping to reap great rewards before the oncoming waves smash into the shores? Or will you remain in the relative safety of the island&amp;rsquo;s center, where resources have grown scarce? Perhaps you will tap into the power of the mystic energy source - the lifeforce of Atlantis and key to its advanced technology. You may even seek refuge in the vast libraries of the Lost City, hoping to find some tome which will lead to salvation for the doomed isle. Beware though - even as the island sinks into the sea, the Athenians continue to assault Atlantis, hoping to plunder its riches before it disappears beneath the waves.","/boardgame/92120/atlantis-rising"

The lower the number, the better the rank.  The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.

The hoppers move 1, 2, or 3 spaces, depending if they jump from a water space, a flower or a leaf. The hoppers move forward to empty spaces, but can jump backwards if they are taking an opponents' piece. Captured pieces are also worth 1 pt each.  When the board is laid out, the players sit at opposing corners, so the hoppers move orthogonally on the board, but diagonally to the players' view. This can distract you such that you don't quite recognize when a capture might happen.  One of the best features of Subulata is that one hopper may threaten other hoppers without being at risk itself. This allows you to build an attack from which there is no defense.

As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?

Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.        Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.      Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!   Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck. As you progress in the game your Deck will become stronger and more efficient. You must use the cards in your deck to fight the &amp;quot;Infected&amp;quot; creatures which awards you Decorations .

A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.  Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &amp;quot;how many fat monks do you have?&amp;quot;.) Players may either take a &amp;quot;vow of silence&amp;quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &amp;quot;Mass&amp;quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.","/boardgame/915/mystery-abbey"

Your mystical influences will link these lounge-goers into social cliques that give you access to the coolest party-people that all the hipsters want to be near. Mix a few drinks, rack up the magical monkey points, and crown yourself king of the Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge.  Score monkeys to hang on your martini glass by adding Jivecat contacts to your clique and claiming Trend cards through skillful manipulation of your lounge contacts. Be the player with the most monkeys at the end of the round in which a player scores their fifteenth monkey and be crowned the winner!  Players are dealt a hand of four cards and on their turn use those cards for their face value to claim low-brow contacts in the lounges or use the card's special powers to claim Jivecat contacts and cast spells (Zombie, Rada, Cheval, and Voodoo).  For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.  However, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.  In these ways, players create &amp;quot;cliques&amp;quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivacat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.  During play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.  Each player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.  Game end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.  To add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.","/boardgame/99655/swinging-jivecat-voodoo-lounge"

By cleverly positioning these guests (and by manipulating the guests of your opponents), you'll vie for the attention of Venice's elite guild masters, ensuring the most political power for your family.  Gameplay revolves chiefly around the clever use of guest cards with varying levels of influence. Each player receives a hand of guest cards, and each guest card has an influence value and its own power, e.g., the peddler, the assasin and the gondolier. The higher the influence, the greater that guest's clout at court. Each player's hand consists of a mix of cards representing members of any of the families currently in play. Use a rival family's guest cards against them, and watch for chances to set up your own house for success.  Each of the rooms of the Doge's palace offer tokens representing a guild's favor or valuable ducats to be won by ambitious nobles. The spaces between each card that represents a room in the palace are the hallways of the Doge's estate &amp;ndash; the areas in which guest cards are placed to compete for adjacent resources.","/boardgame/65673/masques"

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.  The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &amp;ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &amp;ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &amp;quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&amp;quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &amp;quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&amp;quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &amp;ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &amp;ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.  During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.  As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.  If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.","/boardgame/67361/rails-new-england"

While sneaking through the abbey, the novices must remain watchful for the Abbess or Prioress, who are on patrol to ensure that pure novices remain that way.

The players are ambitious Romans striving for influence in the Roman Empire. While striving for power, happiness and wealth, they leave their own village and travel towards the City of Rome. The road to Rome is long and there are many ways to reach your life purpose. As a hardworking farmer you can work the land and grow large quantities of grain and wine. A clever farmer irrigates the land to improve the yield of his harvest. Trading your harvested goods for the best price may bring you the means to move up the ladder of the Roman hierarchy. When will you decide to move on and buy yourself an army of Centurions? Or will you choose the sacred way of Religion and serve the ruthless Roman Gods? Along the way, you will have the opportunity to find happiness and wealth in marriage. Will you take this chance to become happy or not? If you contribute well to the Roman Empire, you will grow in the favor of the Emperor and move further to Rome. Will the citizens of Rome welcome you jubilantly?  Coming nearer to Rome and the Emperor's Palace the tension in the game becomes higher. Which of the players has contributed most to the Empire? And which of the players has saved the city in times of crisis? Just when water and food supplies become exhausted or Centurions are needed to protect Rome against a hostile invasion, only the most prestigious Romans show their courage and value. The Emperor will reward this Roman with golden Fortuna coins, and the deeper the crisis, the richer the reward. When a player has reached the centre of Rome, only the player who has done most for the Emperor and the People of Rome will become Victorious.  Make sure to be in the City of Rome so you are able to take that triumphal march to Victory!  How to win the game? The player with the highest number of Victory Points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when one player gets to the Center of Rome (the Palace of the Emperor), then this final round is completed. Scoring in the game is partly based on the number of steps you have made towards Rome = each step is one VP. The other Victory Points are scored by collecting the right combination of privilege cards and resources. The VP scored with the privately held privilege cards stays a secret till the end of the game when the total scoring is revealed.","/boardgame/80979/fortuna"

Using content from their Strange Adventures in Infinite Space computer game, Cheapass has made the new Diceland into a ship-to-ship combat game.  From the Cheapass Games website:  Diceland is a tabletop combat game that uses paper dice as the characters. The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The &amp;quot;paper&amp;quot; in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.  Diceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.  Space: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that&amp;rsquo;s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.  Space: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones. Also in the Garthans vs. Muktians box, you'll find the 50-point Yellow Kawangi die, a bizarre and powerful die that's sure to be illegal in tournaments any day now.

Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the &amp;lsquo;olden days&amp;rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.  In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.  Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes. Rules and components are in English and German.  Keytown is Richard Breese's third game in the key series.","/boardgame/768/keytown"

The city's wealth depends on fishing and the trading of salted fish. Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?  In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.  In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.  The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:       City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building     Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen     Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods     Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market   On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.  In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.","/boardgame/97273/upon-salty-ocean"

Until they came.  The creatures of nightmare &amp;mdash; vampires, werewolves, and ghouls &amp;mdash; have begun to appear throughout the world, and they show no sign of hesitation in claiming the dark world as their own!  --  Publisher Blurb  Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.  Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.  After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.  The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek.  Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.  Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.  The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&amp;rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!  Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play.  The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone.  Integrates with:      Nightfall: Martial Law     Nightfall: Blood Country     Nightfall: The Coldest War     Nightfall: Dark Rages     Nightfall: Eastern Skies","/boardgame/88408/nightfall"

The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.  When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.  Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.  The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal. No lead is safe and no two matches are ever the same making each game a unique and often humorous experience. The name is the combination of Scrum (a Rugby term where players strive for possession of the ball) and Brawl (a roaring fight, in our case, to the death). ScrumBrawl is the inaugural title for VicTim Games LLC.  Game time ranges from 20-40 minutes for a 2 player game, 30-45 minutes for a 3 player game, and 40-60 minutes for a 4 player game.","/boardgame/87141/scrumbrawl"

Here's a game description from the back of the box:  &amp;quot;For a brief period the Industrial Revolution burned so bright that Britain was known as the 'Workshop of the World.' This Ragnar Brothers' game recreates that dramatic time. Players establish their position on the map-board by investing in ports, heavy industries, textiles, light industries and crafts. Canal networks are built to connect the thriving towns. Expenditure is vast, but capital gains are greater. Next the railways are built and each player seeks to strengthen their industrial base. By game end, towns are linked from London to Wales, Scotland to the Channel ports. Wealth decides the winner.&amp;quot;  And here's the game play described in more detail:  &amp;bull; The game lasts two eras &amp;ndash; the Canal Era and Railroad Era &amp;ndash; with players earning money at the end of each era.  &amp;bull; Before starting an era, players each reveal one of their two demand tokens to show which towns (ports, textile locations, etc.) have special value.  &amp;bull; Each era lasts a number of rounds, and in each round players reveal town cards equal to the number of players, then hold an auction for turn order. Players choose towns in turn order, placing an Industry marker on that location, then optionally building links from that town, ideally forming a network of links that connects their Industries.  &amp;bull; Once the town cards run out, the era ends. Players (may) reveal their second demand token, then they collect money equal to their revenue (earned by connecting Industries with links), the demand value of their Industries, and the value of their largest network of links, with token payment for any remaining links.  &amp;bull; Between eras, the game is reset Amun-Re-style, with revenues being zeroed out and all links being cleared from the board. Players' Industries remain in place, letting them build on their holdings in the second era, which otherwise plays out nearly identical to the first.","/boardgame/67972/workshop-world"

In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.  Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.  Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.","/boardgame/827/attila"

The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:        A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;      Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;      And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.   Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it. or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).  Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.  The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.  This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &amp;quot;expandable&amp;quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot;!","/boardgame/79131/star-trek-expeditions"

From the rule booklet:  In the City of Katzburg, merchants are all discussing the big news. The mayor, Henry-Cat, has signed a trade agreement with the newly-discovered continent of Felinia. In exchange for precious goods (rare books, fine wines, precision watches, luxury clothing, and refined glassware), the Kingdoms of Felinia have agreed to let them install trading posts.  Space is limited: You will have to act very quickly!  Four ships have been chartered by the City to visit the five countries on Felinia. To board them, you must have a specific combination of merchandise provided by the markets of the City and requested by the leaders of Felinia. This also means you will have to earn money to be able to afford those purchases.  The prices of the various merchandises are set by supply and demand, and can sometimes go very high! But it is the price you must pay to be on board one of the ships with hopes to establish a trading post on Felinia. Maybe you can collect gold and spices in the process!

A brief rundown on how the game plays: There are 4 phases in every turn.  Each turn starts with the Strategy phase, where players roll to determine who is the attacker and who is the defender for that turn. The player that rolls the highest can choose to be either.  The next phase is the attacker&amp;rsquo;s Action phase. In this phase, each of the attacker&amp;rsquo;s warriors can take one action. A warrior can move, shoot or do nothing as its action. Once the attacker is finished with all of his or her actions, the defender now gets their action phase.  The final phase is the Combat phase. This is when your warriors fight. Warriors killed in this phase aren&amp;rsquo;t removed until the very end, so they will at least get to fight back if they are struck down.","/boardgame/8139/lord-rings-combat-hex-tradeable-miniatures-game"

Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:  &amp;quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&amp;quot;  Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&amp;mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:  &amp;quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &amp;mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&amp;mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&amp;quot;  With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as  &amp;quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&amp;quot;  In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.  But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:  &amp;quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&amp;quot;  As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.  The game is set up in a &amp;quot;Programmed Instruction&amp;quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &amp;quot;Flores died on the way up&amp;quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.  Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.  Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5","/boardgame/670/starship-troopers"

Reserved pieces can be entered on a turn in any space on the board in place of making a move of pieces; strategic use of reserved pieces can make the game by utilizing them to capture stacks controlled by opponent(s).

It is a bidding game. The new bidding system is: You have an auctioneer. He sells several open cards. He decides the selling order (one by one). The others make clockwise just one bid or no bid. The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.  The cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points. For that you need money and resources (mainly from other production places).  Problem: If you build late (next period started) you get less or nothing.  At the end you get extra points for good improvement combinations and production places that work together.  Reimplemented by:       Industry","/boardgame/8124/industria"

Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.  Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.  In 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new &amp;quot;King of the World&amp;quot;. A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far.  In the West an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere?  In the North the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders.  In the South Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him.  In the East the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!  Will you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?  Assyrian Wars is a multi player game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well.  Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse.  Assyrian Wars is a point to point game.  Assyrian Wars gives an easy entry for beginners.  Still the game provides complex games situations depending on players strategy. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.  For the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.  Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them. Can you overcome the massive city walls and water your horses at the Rivers of Babylon?

Between 1665 and his death in 1680, Riquet was completely anbsorbed by the planning, financing and construction of his canal system.  Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.  You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne. Each player is an engineer who must use their best workers to build the greatest length of the Arriala (cannal in the Occitan language of southern France). You can move all workers, but only those on your team will gain you fame points for completing sections. The placement of your workers when construction is completed is critical.  Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?  Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game. What's more, your expertise also extends to cultivating the  vines that make this region famous and will bring you valuable points when the game ends.","/boardgame/70097/arriala-canal-de-garonne"

They try to attract new customers, making sure they can serve them in time, increasing their fortune and fame at the same time.  Of course, this is easier said than done as many things can go wrong while trying to serve a customer: People change their minds, orders go wrong and restaurant owners try to sabotage each other.  Can you become the most successful Greek restaurant owner?  Souvlaki Wars is a light family card game for 2-4 players. Players draft new customers and try to serve them with food cards they draw at the beginning of each turn. This way they earn the money and the reputation each customer represents. However, before they have a chance to do so, cards with &amp;quot;Unforeseen Events&amp;quot; are played by every player, affecting the game in many different ways like altering the order in lines, adding more customers, decreasing the opponent's reputation etc. And of course, each player has to take into consideration that the customers are served on a first-come basis. If someone's order can't be fulfilled, everyone behind him will have to wait another turn...  The first player to reach a certain level of money and reputation is declared the winner.  The game is going to be published by the Greek company &amp;quot;Kaissa Chess &amp;amp; Games&amp;quot; during 2011. It is going to be bilingual, having text both in Greek and English.

Each player starts the game with a different-colored donkey, then two cards are removed from play and five cards laid out face-up.

Includes data on 72 different types of aircraft.

Aces High even has rules for different types of missions, from photo-reconnaissance to balloon busting to bombing.  The number of maneuvers is limited to banks, turns, sideslips, and half-loops. For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.  There is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.

The deck has blue cards numbered 1 to 15 and red cards numbered -5 and -10. According to the number of players, you're dealt a hand and then the scoring cards are laid out. So with 6 players, you get 9 cards and compete for 5 on the table. The scoring cards are sorted from lowest to highest and everybody chooses a card from their hand and shows it. The lowest value card wins the lowest scoring card (which could easily be a negative!). That player is out and the remaining players choose another card. Whoever has the lowest total takes the next lowest scoring card and is out, and so on , until there are 2 players left competing for the final scoring card. Again, you add a card to your total, and whoever now has the HIGHEST total wins the last scoring card. Which means that if you can't go for the prize, you try to duck out earlier. Get it wrong and you've no chance of getting points. Play twice through the deck and the highest points scored wins.  Part of the Goldsieber à la Carte line of games.","/boardgame/853/und-tschuss"

In the 11th century A.D. the empire is torn between four factions, two of them provincial, military aristocracies (the houses of Comnenid and Phocas) and two of them urban, secular aristocracies (the houses of the Dukes and Angels). It is 1025, and the emperor Basileios II has ascended into the heavens without providing for an heir. In Constantinople, representatives from the most important aristocratic families vie for their favored to inherit the Emperor's ring and throne.  It is a futile and petty dispute as each family is not about to surrender the throne to any of the others, but they ultimately decide that the winner will be the one who's supported by most of the wealthiest cities of the empire. Every ambitious successor raises the banner of  his dynasty and begins the struggle to win over the cities that will secure him the throne.  Each family secretly chooses seven imperial cities that they will seek to control through the actions available to them: Commandment, Diplomacy, Exile, Trade, Garrison, Espionage, and Corruption. May the rightful heir arise!   Nekken is a fantasy-themed implementation of this game using the exact same materials as Byzantio and with a map on the reverse side of the game board, giving a different game experience and essentially two games in one.  Four tribes have been living in peace for over 3000 years despite the ancient hatred of each other. United in the capital city Nekken, they slowly forgot their fear of the large volcano that looms over the metropolis &amp;ndash; until the volcano erupted. Forced to abandon their homes, the tribes spread throughout the continent, facing danger in many forms while trying to establish new colonies. Their ancient hatred has also been awakened and now they must struggle to survive. However, they still need each other, a new cold war emerges in the shadow of the searing heat of the volcano.  In Nekken, each player takes the role of a leader of their tribe and tries to be the one who will prevail and become the ruler of this new society. The goal is to achieve prestige through the establishment of new and glorious cities, using actions to move their leader on the map, exploring, establishing cities, betraying friends to achieve their objective. Hopefully no other ruler intends on settling in the same place!","/boardgame/98739/byzantio"

Each turn in Grimoire starts by revealing several cards on the game board; each card has either a victory point (VP) value or is a character with a particular way to earn VPs at the end of the game. Once these cards are revealed, each player secretly chooses which spell to cast in his spellbook by placing a bookmark on the appropriate page. Everyone then reveals which spell they chose, with the spells going off in order from weakest (those with the lowest numbers) to strongest. Some weak spells nerf stronger ones, and the order in which players choose cards from the display can be flipped topsy-turvy depending on who plays which spells.  In the One Draw and Z-Man versions, the game ends as soon as one player has collected either ten character cards or ten treasure cards; in the Schmidt Spiele version, the game ends after a fixed number of rounds. All players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.  Differences between the versions:       As noted above, the game ending conditions differ in the 2012 Schmidt Spiele version.     The Z-Man Games and Schmidt Spiele versions of Grimoire accommodate five players, while the original One Draw release allows only 2-4 players.     The Schmidt Spiele version contains four new character cards and two new treasure cards, includes hardcover books instead of softcover, changes two spells, and uses a more elaborate game board that depicts the spells and allows players to mark the spells chosen with small figures to track who has played what.","/boardgame/73863/grimoire"

The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &amp;quot;goal line stand&amp;quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &amp;quot;long gains&amp;quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.  Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.  For variety, three types of offense (&amp;quot;pro style&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;aerial game&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ball control&amp;quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.  Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &amp;quot;More Information&amp;quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.  For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.","/boardgame/951/football-strategy"

Many of the rule changes found in the later Axis &amp;amp; Allies Revised &amp;amp; Anniversary editions (such as the 2-hit battleships, &amp;quot;1/2 battleship&amp;quot; destroyers, artillery guns) were original innovations in The World at War, first published in 1990 with 238 playing pieces and a new 24&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot; map that added more territories. As an expansion, much of the 1984 edition of Axis &amp;amp; Allies was needed to play this expansion.  The World at War 1939-1945 2nd Edition, published in 1993, balanced some of the gameplay and added some new ideas but retained the same glossy 24&amp;quot;x36&amp;quot; color map and pieces.  The 3rd Edition, published in 1996, continued to improve gameplay balance and added Atomic Bombs to the technology development. After developing A-bomb technology, players spend 6 IPCs to buy one, which must be delivered via a Heavy Bomber (also a required technology). Damage to a land or sea zone by an A-bomb eliminates 20 IPCs worth of enemy units and renders the territory desolate (-5 IPC value, with +1 restoration each turn for two turns), causing devastation to the economy as well as military of an opposing player.  Now in its 4th edition, The World at War includes a hardback map (replacing the poster-paper map of earlier editions), with some minor rule revisions over the 3rd ed, and this is a mature game in it's own right with differences significant enough for any A&amp;amp;A fan to appreciate, beyond all of the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; editions published in recent years.  There are new unit types, such as Destoyers, Paratroopers, SS Panzers and SS Panzergrenadiers, Russian Guards, Partisans. US Marines, Rangers and Armored Infantry, U-Boat Pens (complete with the plastic figurines and/or special rules).

The railroad is being built, and to you and the other gangs in the badlands of South Dakota, this means one thing: cold, hard cash. As a cowboy on the wrong side of the law you know just how to take control of this shanty-town: threaten, fight, and kill off your rivals.  Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.  At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.  A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &amp;quot;annexing&amp;quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.  Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive. The player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner!","/boardgame/96713/deadwood"

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&amp;rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.  All artwork and graphics in the game Sam Grant was created by RPG/Historical artist,  Eric Hotz.","/boardgame/83/sam-grant"

American Carrom can also be played with a cue, and the board is patterned with checkers, chess or other board motifs, allowing a variety of other games to be played.  Many American Carrom boards also double as Crokinole boards.  In American Carrom the object is to flick to strike the Carrom men into the pockets in a similar fashion to pool or billiards.  Sometimes a cue is used rather than flicking.  Due to the larger pocket size American Carrom lacks some of the strategy and skill required of the 'proper' version of the game.  Also noteworthy is the fact that American Carrom uses rings for game pieces whereas Carrom game pieces are solid discs.

Decks with different backs are a must.  Players all deal 13 cards into a draw pile and four cards out in front of themselves.  When play commences, players simultaneously try to empty their draw pile by building on the four cards in front of them (red sevens on black eights, black sixes on red sevens etc.) and try to put cards into set piles in the middle of the table starting with the Ace of a given suit and then the two and three and so on. Players build on each others' set piles so this can lead to some very energetic competitions.  The remaining cards that a player has are kept in a deck and counted out and turned over three at a time, placed face up, and then the top facing card can be added to the set piles or to the four working piles in front of the player.  When a player has emptied the draw pile and yells out &amp;quot;Nertz&amp;quot; play stops and points are counted up - one point for each card in the middle of the table in the set piles, and -2 points for every card left in the draw pile.  First player to an agreed upon score is the winner.  This game has been packaged and released as Solitaire Frenzy.","/boardgame/7263/solitaire-frenzy"

Every round each player has 3 available actions: Hiring, Winemaking, and Trading. Players perform actions in turn, and the order in which they perform them has consequences. In the Hiring-action, the player hires a winemaker or a winemaster who can make wine, and he can hire the Lobbyist or Mr. Ros&amp;eacute; who can influence the market place. In the winemaking-action the player makes wine and in the Trading-action he buys or sells it at the Wine Stock Market. The player with the most money in the end wins.

It was (and still is) the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. The Great Khan rules from the capital Karakorum over the empire and he sends out his best generals to conquer more areas for the ruler of all Mongols. Mongol strategy gives individual generals a high degree of independence in deciding how to invade and conquer new territories, so long as they keep to the overall objectives. The Mongol armies are highly mobile and enemies are terrorized by their ability to appear everywhere at once. To prevent enemy rulers from being able to regain control of their armies, the Mongols drive the rulers out and pursue them relentlessly wherever they flee.  In KHAN it's your task to chase out the 8 different rulers of the lands that you are invading and to conquer as many valuable areas as you can. The general that fulfills this task the best will be proclaimed the next Great Khan.  Each player invades areas by placing his yurts on the board. A player can then conquer two or more adjacent areas by laying one of the variously shaped conquer tiles over the yurts (not all the yurts need to be the player's own). Conquer tiles will bring the player victory points - the larger the conquer tile, the greater the number of victory points. At the end of the game the players with the largest connected conquered territories will gain additional victory points.

You don't want to be that guy. You don't &amp;quot;go all in,&amp;quot; you don't always keep your promises, and you don't do &amp;quot;what's best for the group.&amp;quot; Instead, you do everything you can to become indispensable, and &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; is literal here &amp;ndash; even if it means stealing from, betraying, and blackmailing other players.  In order to escape from Alcatraz, the players need to complete six parts of a plan. Each part is a &amp;quot;pick-up and deliver&amp;quot; task requiring specific items obtained in different parts of the prison. Once each part of the plan is completed, every player but the scapegoat moves a little closer to escaping, with the scapegoat being voted on each round by all the players &amp;ndash; most likely the player who contributed the least to completing that particular task, but you never know. Thus, you could say that Alcatraz is a cooperative game &amp;ndash; but with a twist.  The map of the prison constituting the play area is generated randomly each game, providing high replayability.

The inside of the board is an abstracted map of the United States. There are no fixed &amp;quot;color groups;&amp;quot; rather, your controlled outer spaces (&amp;quot;Markets&amp;quot;) are the major cities of the USA, and you need to use the inner map to connect these markets.

Each player starts the game with money and three randomly dealt Power cards, with these cards being triangular and having a number from 1 to 7 in each corner. The race takes place on a circular track, with the start/end space being chosen by a player for the first round.  On a turn, each player selects one Power card in secret, then lays it down with the value being played pointing toward the game board. Players reveal their cards one at a time, moving forward on the track; if a player would finish his movement on an occupied space, he moves his vehicle the same number of spaces once again, repeating this process, if needed. Once everyone has finished, each player pays the leader the amount showing on the space where his car stands.  If a player chose 1-3 for his movement, he draws a replacement Power card; otherwise, he must use one of the cards remaining in hand. The round ends once a player reaches the end marker or once all players cannot or choose not to play a Power card. The first two (or three) players on the track advance on a central scoring path, with players being able to pay money to advance additional spaces.  Players then reset for the next race with a new hand of Power cards and continue playing. The game ends when one or more players reach the dream island at the end of the central scoring track, with the player who advances the farthest winning. In the case of a tie, the tied player who did better in the final race wins.","/boardgame/91668/avanti"

The two teams are:  &amp;bull; Sultan and Guards (Loyalists) &amp;ndash; to win, they must eliminate all the Assassins and have no more than two Slaves still in play, or the Sultan must survive for a round after being revealed. &amp;bull; Assassins and Slaves (Rebels) &amp;ndash; to win, they must kill the Sultan or have three Slaves seated adjacently with their identities revealed, in which case a slave revolution brings down the Sultan.  The number of role cards in play equals one more than the number of players, with exactly one Sultan, as many Guards as Assassins (with at least one in play), and at least three Slaves in the mix. Zero to four neutral characters will also be in play, each unique and each with the ability to win with one team or the other. The Slave Driver, for example, wins with the Rebels if face-down when the round ends and wins with the Loyalists if face-up, while the Fortune Teller must correctly predict the winning team.  At the start of the game, each player secretly receives one role card, with one card placed face-down in the middle of the table. On a turn, a player can peek at another player's role card, switch/hide (if your role is face-down, switch cards with another player or the spare role card; if face-up, make other players hide their eyes, then secretly switch with any other face-down role card), or use a character action: Guards can detain other players, forcing them to lose their turn; Slaves try to bring about a revolution; Assassins can eliminate any player at the risk of a Guard intervening and killing them instead.  The neutral characters have more complex actions. The Belly Dancer, for example, neutralizes adjacent Guards, preventing them from detaining others or warding off assassination &amp;ndash; but only if she's revealed. (If she's revealed and using her powers, she's working for a Rebel win; otherwise she can stay hidden and score if the Loyalists win.) The Vizier can force another player to reveal himself and use his special action.  Players on the winning team score one or two points depending on whether they were face-up &amp;ndash; that is, working publicly for the cause &amp;ndash; or face-down. At the end of a round, redeal all the role cards. The player with the most points after five rounds wins the game.","/boardgame/94365/sultans-karaya"

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side's lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.  This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &amp;quot;fog of war&amp;quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.  WestFront II includes updated MedFront maps and some Spanish units; EuroFront II has the updated MedFront rules (and the Spanish Civil War scenario and other Spanish units) for those maps.

You will stake claims to the various mining regions of Charon, acquire resources for building facilities, use special actions (fair and unfair) to gain advantages over other CEOs, and build your empire to achieve victory in this fast-paced game of planetary domination!    Game Summary The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more &amp;quot;senior&amp;quot; if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).  After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.  After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.","/boardgame/71593/charon-inc"

The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.  Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.  The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement.   The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.  The game consists of a 32&amp;quot; by 22&amp;quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.

It is meant as an expansion to the Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord also published by Atlas Games, but Tomb of the Lich Lord is not necessary to play this set, as Vault of the Fiends is also a stand-alone set.  Players play the part of one of six heroes.  Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent ""Dungeonlord"", trying to exterminate the other heroes.  You win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. An alternate win goal is as the Dungeonlord if all the other heroes are defeated except yours.  Vault of the Fiends features a variety of new heroes.  Elf Assassin, Human Beastmaster, Drakan Sentinal, Ork Shaman, Dwarf Runecaster, and Gnome Illusionist.  Each turn you may:       Play monsters, traps and other bad events on opponents      Build a dungeon      Move around the dungeon with your hero (collect Glory and Peril resources)      Play abilities and treasures for yourself      Complete a Quest      Discard an unwanted card      Fill your hand to 5 cards     This game is similar to Wiz-War where you race in a dungeon to complete your objectives.  This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.  Combat is similar to Talisman. Roll a six-sided die and add the score you are combating with, either Melee or Magic, to beat your opponent&amp;rsquo;s roll.  The way the cards interact will be familiar to CCG players, in that you have ""Permanents"" and ""Instants"" that you can use strategically, or in combinations, but this game is not really a strategy game.  Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.  Vault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are ""pumpable"" that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are ""artifact"" Quests, such as the Armor Golem&amp;rsquo;s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.  These do not confer a level, but are rotated 180 degrees so you can read the bonus they provide.  Part of the Dungeoneer Series.","/boardgame/8207/dungeoneer-vault-fiends"

The standard 1936-1939 game requires not other components than those provided in this game. It is played on the map of Europe and the Pacific and uses an abstract combat system to represent the conflicts occurring in this period. The 1936-1946 Grand Campaign Game require World in Flames to be used in conjunction with Days of Decision to resolve the military conflicts. Finally, there is also a World in Flames mini scenario of the Spanish Civil War which requires some components from World in Flames.   This game can be played alone or as a pre-game of 1930s politics for World in Flames also by ADG.  The game is about who will (if any) declare the Second World War, how the production of the Major Powers are at the time of war  and how the many small nations will align (Axis or Allied).

Each player starts with a hand of six cards that feature an animal on the back and one or two traits on the front.  Each round consists of four phases. During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.  During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.  During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &amp;quot;feeding&amp;quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &amp;ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.  During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile. Each player then receives new cards in hand equal to one plus the number of live animals that player has.  When the deck runs out, the players conduct one final round, then score points. Each live animal is worth 2 VP, and each trait on a live animal worth 1 VP; some traits (Carnivorous and Parasite) provide bonus VPs, but make it tougher to keep an animal alive. The player with the most VPs wins.  By combining two sets of Evolution, you can have up to eight players in a game.","/boardgame/71021/evolution-origin-species"

The game is easy to learn and provides a vivid atmosphere with lots of laughter.  To prepare the game, a plastic disk is placed in the centre of the table and each player marks one of his hands &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; and the other &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; (or one can say that the right hand is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; and the left hand is &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;).  In a turn, a question is read out loud and all the players have to answer with &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;false&amp;quot; as fast as possible, using their hands. For instance, if the answer is &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.  Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.  Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.  To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types: Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man) Concerning the player (You have a dog) Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar) General questions (King Kong was an ape)  The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.

Players compete as individuals or are grouped into two clans, and they try to land their stones the closest to a target each round. On a player's turn he takes two actions:  &amp;bull; He launches a stone across the ice, flicking it with his finger toward the target on the other end of the game board.  &amp;bull; To improve the positioning of his stone or the chances of it staying in place, he can choose to use either a small or large hammer or a totem. With a hammer, the player moves the stone according to the size of the hammer. As for the totem, the player sets it on top of the stone; if the totem falls off the stone, the player can shoot it again on a later turn.  If your player or clan has one or more stones closer to the center of the target than the other clan, you score points. The first player/clan to collect six points wins.

Caveman Curling (2012) Kairn (2010)  There are significant production differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling, though the game play is almost identical between the two versions. Kairn (200 copies) was designed and self-published by Daniel Quodbach in 2010. Blackrock Editions and Scorpion Masque produced 1000 copies of Kairn and released it at Essen in 2011.

Caveman Curling is scheduled for mass production in January, 2012, and to be released in late February, 2012. The first and only production copy of the Gryphon version will arrive in the US on December 14, 2011 and a video will be made showing the differences between Kairn and Caveman Curling.","/boardgame/67453/caveman-curling"

The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &amp;quot;jump lines&amp;quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &amp;quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.  As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &amp;quot;Prestige.&amp;quot; These &amp;quot;contracts&amp;quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.","/boardgame/673/star-traders"

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.

Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.  Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.  Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.  Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &amp;quot;merchant&amp;quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).  Overall, the game falls squarely into the &amp;quot;simultaneous solitaire&amp;quot; category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.","/boardgame/8166/anno-1503"

Each player is a waiter trying to deliver his stack of dishes before anyone else, with the dishes being represented by a stack of colored chips on a face-down card.  Players each have a hand of cards, a few of which might be special action cards while the majority will be divided into two narrow rectangles. To play these cards, the player chooses two cards and uses the right half of one card and the left half of the other. Thus with a handful of cards, each half of a card can be combined in up to a half-dozen ways. The cards let you take actions like moving a token from one stack to another, with the primary action being to deliver food. When you deliver a dish, however, everyone with that type of dish on top of his stack gets to deliver it, so ideally you can first place a token on the opponent&amp;rsquo;s stack in order to lock down that dish.  You can also split your stack into two or more stacks, thereby giving you more opportunities to deliver dishes &amp;ndash; but doing so reduces your hand size and limits the chances that you'll be able to do what you want!","/boardgame/67309/hey-waiter"

Every player will then have a share of tiles, and a scoring phase follows.  Tactical play will help you get the meat, fur, tusks, animals, and tools you want (each tile has a different way of scoring), but you may also play cards for immediate effects or to secretly influence the scoring.  - Game material is language independent -","/boardgame/95613/mammut"

The opponent takes one of those cards and places it on their side of the board, adding to their power in that category; the other card is added to the score for that category at the end of the game.

Nine cards are dealt face-up in a circle around the igloos, with each card showing a different number (or range of numbers).  Players then start shaking the igloos to find one that matches the number of beads shown on a card.  When a match is found, the player marks that igloo with a colored chip and places it on the card with the same number.  If the guess is correct, that player receives the card (worth points) as a reward.  If the guess is incorrect, that player loses the chip used to mark the igloo.  The game is finished when one player has no chips left, or when all of the cards have been claimed!  Although the appearance of Igloo Pop is quite silly, it takes a steady hand and well-trained ear to be able to determine how many beads are inside an igloo.  The sound and vibration when shaking each igloo is slightly different, allowing skilled players to judge the contents quickly and accurately.  Also, a risk/reward system is introduced in the cards: cards with several numbers are easier to guess, but are worth less points; cards with a single number are often difficult to guess exactly, but are worth more points.  Background story, from the back of the box: The young ice giant has a big problem: he wants to buy fish sticks, but he cannot remember how many and he has nine shopping lists in his basket.  So he goes from igloo to igloo and shakes each. In each he listens to the delicious fish sticks bouncing off the igloo walls. When he thinks that the igloo in his hand has the same number of fish sticks as one of his shopping lists, he takes it home.  When he gets home, there are no fish sticks in the igloo. Instead, wild and laughing Inuit children tumble out of the igloo. Excitedly they shout, &amp;quot;Shake us again!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;That was great fun!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;This is super&amp;quot;, thinks the young ice giant. &amp;quot;Now, I have found some new friends to play with!&amp;quot; And, he promptly forgets all about his shopping lists.","/boardgame/8668/igloo-pop"

The deeper the player dives, the more treasure the player can scavenge, but the more perilous the expedition. As each player descends into the dark murky waters, they will have to watch out for nasty sharks, earthquakes and worst of all, the other Divers!  D3 puts a new twist on push-your-luck games, because like a co-op game, your planning and actions determine each others' success, but unlike a co-op game, all players scheme to get more treasure than the rest. This coupled with the very interactive Event Cards will create an engaging playing atmosphere that will keep everyone on their toes. It has shown to be a good game for families, girlfriends and wives.

Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&amp;eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.  There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &amp;quot;bad stuff&amp;quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.

Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &amp;quot;tribe&amp;quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.  This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &amp;quot;water path&amp;quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.  From the back of the box:  300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?  Description from Uberplay's web site:  While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.","/boardgame/9028/tongiaki-journey-unknown"

The game features various scenarios in which the average infantry squad would become involved.  Typical scenarios simulate meeting engagements, ambushes, raids, snatch missions and assualts on fortified positions.  Sequel to the game Sniper! (first edition) Popular tactical combat system.  As in Sniper, each player controls the equivalent of a squad of 5 to 15 men depending on the period, the scenario, and whether you attack or defend. One scenario corresponds to a few (one to five) minutes of real time action. The scale is a little larger than in Sniper (5 meters/hex, 5 seconds/turn vs 3 and 3 in Sniper), and there is no facing. The game system (though rated 7.1, ie pretty high, on SPI complexity scale), is quite straightforward and easy to learn. In the beginning of each turn, players secretly &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; actions for all of their men. A normal man has 10 Movement Points to expend per turn. Fire, direct or opportunity, consumes all MP, as reloading one's weapon, or rearming (ie readying to use it after throwing a grenade or shooting a rifle grenade). Standing up, preparing a grenade, throwing it, cost 5MP. And movement costs MP depending on terrain... After all actions have been plotted, players check for panic: a certain percentage of all your men, depending on their hex number, have their actions canceled, or move randomly. (although very annoying, this rule does wonders at simulating low level control problems). Then, all remaining actions are performed: combat, movement, and finally grenade and artillery impacts. Rules cover a large variety of equipment: weapons like rifles, MP, MG, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and flamethrowers, but also barbed wire, pillboxes, artillery, mines, and up to one vehicle (APC or tank) per side. Five kind of combat situations are covered: patrol, reconnaissance, ambush, raid and assault. Some lending themselves quite well to solitaire play. A large number of scenarios (from WWI to modern) are provided, and you can easily design your own. A standard scenario plays in a couple of hours. Altogether, I think the system is pretty good for such a man to man combat situation. However, be warned that this very detailed scale has a peculiar feeling, which not all &amp;quot;tactical&amp;quot; game players (ie players used to ASL or Gamers TCS, which focus on company/battalion level units) will like: in Patrol! the player is a sergeant, not a captain. review by: Francois Charton  Game Scale: Game Turn: 5 seconds to 5 minutes Hex: 5.4 yards / 5 meters Units: Individual Soldiers &amp;amp; Vehicles  Game Inventory: Six 9 x 9&amp;quot; four color maps One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&amp;quot; counters) One 32-page Patrol rulebook Foure Player Aids Cards Two 6-sided dice  Solitaire Playability: Medium Complexity Level: Medium Players: 1 or more Playing Time: 2-6 hours","/boardgame/8037/patrol-man-man-combat-20th-century"

A few spots in the arena can grant players a bonus, such as taking a gem, receiving an extra turn, or placing a barrier in the arena. Once a player completes a task, he reveals the next card and starts flicking once again. If a player has finished all eight missions and collected two gemstones of each type, he wins the game.","/boardgame/66116/snapshot"

Van Helsing tries to find and destroy all of the vampire's coffins, while the count tries to find five victims. Will the horror end tonight or will the count's reign of terror continue?  Dracula is part of the Kosmos two-player series.  Dracula is a two player game hand management/memory game. One player takes the role of Professor Van Helsing, the other player is Dracula. Van Helsing is trying to locate and destroy Dracula's coffins whilst Dracula is attempting to find victims that he can turn in to vampires.  Each player has a deck of cards which they place face-down on the board. These cards contain the coffins/victims that they other player must find to win. They also contain minions, helpers and traps that can harm or distract the other player. Players can also place coloured barriers to obstruct their opponent's progress.  Players move their pieces by playing from a second hand of action cards. Each action card contains an ability and a distance to be moved. When a player ends their move they reveal the card that their piece has landed on and (if it is one of their own) replace it with a new card. By a process of elimination and deduction they are trying to find their target cards before their health is worn down to zero by their opponent's traps.","/boardgame/7804/dracula"

Over three epochs the various principalities can be developed. A steady production of money and food is needed to expand the principality and to maintain an army of mercenaries. During the game there are several cultural and military valuations that give the players victory points.  The unusual part of this game are the action cards, which are available to all players. From the changing pool of possible actions, players have to secure the most suitable cards and use them at the appropriate time &amp;ndash; reaching for the new means while parting with the old.

The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.  The remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; the players use to forward their schemes.  Each Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.  And then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).  But hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &amp;hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.  The winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.  Medieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system. It comes with 110 cards, lots of little pieces, and coin-shaped florin markers.","/boardgame/7239/medieval"

In that design, players would create crazy inventions from the adjective and noun cards in their hands, simultaneously choose one invention (other than their own) to invest in, pay to invest in other inventions (whether newly created that round or an earlier creation), then roll a die for each investment to see whether it pays off and if so by how much. The player who collected the most money won.  For the 2011 edition of The Big Idea from French publisher Funforge, Ernest and Funforge's Philippe Nouhra have transformed the design into a true party game by stripping out the elements related to earning money. Players still have a hand of adjective and noun cards, and combine any number of them to create a fancy invention. They then take turns pitching their ideas to everyone in the game, lobbying players as if they were in front of a crowd of venture capitalists. Players then secretly vote on which idea they feel should be rewarded, placing a reward card face down in front of the chosen invention and blank cards in front of all other inventions. The player who collects the most rewards wins the round.  Unlike the Cheapass titles of yore, Funforge's The Big Idea will include high-quality, full-color illustrated cards packaged in a nice box.","/boardgame/94724/big-idea"

That's true. The Five Points area of New York in the mid-1800s was a lurid geographical cancer filled with dilapidated and unlivable tenement houses, gang extortion, corrupt politicians, dance halls and drunkenness and gambling. This was a place where all manner of crime flourished, the residents were terrorized and squalor prevailed. This is the setting over many decades through the nineteenth century.  Five Points: Gangs of New York is a game of struggle for political control of Manhattan in the mid-19th century. As the leader of a powerful political faction, you manipulate gangs and influence politicians behind the scenes to seize control. Effective use of your resources will gain influence, win elections, and let you control the destiny of New York; fail and you will be less than a footnote to history.  Several tools lie at your disposal if you have the strength to acquire and use them. Your loyal rabble will execute your will. Controlling districts with your rabble could give you access to a limited number of important buildings: Tammany Hall, Board of Elections, 5th Ward Offices and many others. Your control of these buildings may provide influence and special powers. Bid for control of election-influencing manipulations that may swing the vote.  In Manhattan, your burgeoning political machine may affect politics in America's great city for over 100 years. At the heart of this machine are the gangs of New York who enforce the will of the bosses and determine elections before the first vote is cast.","/boardgame/93540/five-points-gangs-new-york"

Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).  Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.  Runebound is playable solo and the first edition was updated with a 2nd Edition in 2005 (only 1 year after its release).  Runebound 1st Edition is different from 2nd Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by two 10-sided dice in the 2nd edition, which helped to better balance the luck factor.","/boardgame/9829/runebound-first-edition"

And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &amp;ndash; from the rules to the game play &amp;ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?  The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.  The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.  Building streets is very simple. One a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&amp;rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&amp;rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.  Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&amp;rsquo;t save forever.  The game ends when one player can&amp;rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any trade markers left.  Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.  La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&amp;rsquo;s every player&amp;rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &amp;ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.

At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.  Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.  If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the rules for doing so.  As soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.  A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from his Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in his row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.","/boardgame/943/ligretto"

As in the original The Settlers of Catan board game, players need to manage their resources in order to build settlements, roads, cities, city improvements and knights, all of which grant victory points (VPs) or special abilities. Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.  The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.  The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.  How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &amp;quot;megabucks&amp;quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.  The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.  This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.

The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It's all in the hands of the crew &amp;ndash; your hands.  In Alien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed. To achieve either of these goals, the crew must work together, using their unique skills and chosen actions to perform a number of tasks, defend themselves, and retrieve and repair equipment and the ship.  To establish the actions available each turn, the first player rolls custom dice, then each player chooses an action for the turn, starting with the first player. The available actions include combat, engineering, reload/recharge first aid, scout, and wild; the dice also have an alien icon that shows the speed of the enemy while limiting the actions that players have available to them.

Players fight to hold the yellow jersey when the race ends.  Players are dealt 6 cards and draw a 7th before playing a pace card, and any additional modifiers. There are 84 pace cards numbered between 39 and 50, Spurts (which add 2 to your pace), Headwind (which subtract -2 from your pace) and Mountains (which ensure that no one can take the lead from the current player).  One player starts as the race leader with a yellow token, and plays a speed card. Successive players must match the leader's pace to stay in the Peleton (the race pack), and each enjoys a +2 to their pace card simulating the benefit of decreased wind resistance.  If a player falls more than 2 behind the pack, than they draw chips (representing minutes) equal to the difference from their card and the race pace.  If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.  If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.  You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.  The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.

It includes the &amp;quot;triggered scoring for all&amp;quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.  The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.  Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.  After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.  Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.

Living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering, when few who remain will battle to the last. In the end there can be only one.  Welcome to the incredible world of the immortals, the world of Highlander!  Based on the immensely popular motion pictures and television series, of the same name, Highlander:   The Card Game 2nd edition  is a collectible trading card game of swashbuckling swordplay and dark intrigue.  The first Highlander movie was released in 1986, and became a cult classic.  The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.  In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan. These Immortals are mysterious wanderers who can only die if their heads are severed from their bodies. Immortals spend eternity honing their sword-fighting skills, trying to reach the time of The Gathering, when they will battle to the last. To the victor goes The Prize, an enigmatic goal of legendary proportions that no one really understands. It is simply known among them that he who wields its power will command the destiny of the entire world. Quite a prize indeed.  To attain this goal some Immortals will stop at nothing, while others follow a stricter code of honor and decency in their quest. In the end, for better or worse...  There can be only one.  Highlander: The Card Game is designed to simulate a duel between two Immortals: yourself and your opponent. During the course of play, both players will play attacks and defenses as if they were fighting with swords. Other cards will represent the tricks, tactics, schemes, and plots you utilize to win.","/boardgame/9161/highlander-card-game"

The game-ending floe is shuffled among the bottom four ice floe cards, and each player receives a hand of twelve penguin cards.  Each round, the active player reveals an ice floe card from the deck, then places one or more penguins of the same color (plus jokers) on the table to bid for the card. Other players can increase the bid using the same color or pass. Once everyone but one person drops out, that player discards his bid and collects the ice floe. All other players have the option of discarding their penguins or keeping them in a face-down pile. Players then draw 0, 1 or 2 cards to refill their hands based on the number of cards they played: 0, 1 or 2+.  When the game-ending floe is revealed, the game ends and players discard their hands. Players then compare their ice floe total with their penguin points (the cards collected face-down). If the totals match, the player's score is the sum of penguin points. If the player has more floe points, he subtracts the difference from his penguin score; if he has more penguins than floe, he subtracts twice the difference from his penguin score. High score wins, with the number of floe cards in hand breaking ties.","/boardgame/93733/volle-scholle"

You will recruit trainers, armourers, medics and even prostitutes. You will train free men, slaves, criminals and war prisoners to become gladiators and you will bring them to fight in the arenas throughout Italy. You will manage not only the duels, but the whole life of your gladiators: lead your champions to glory!      Unwinding of a game  In the first round, after a short preparation, the Players take their Gladiators to the arenas for brief introductory Shows: they approach the first challenges of their champions and place their bets on life or death of duelists. After this initial stage, the game takes on its regular sequence. In the first phase, called Forum phase, Players will play aggressive auction for what the market has to offer them: athletes for training and professionals for Gymansium&amp;rsquo;s management. In the second phase, called Munus phase, the Players play the Spectacles, trying to participate with their best Gladiators. Not all spectacles are equal: some have more money gain, others provide more glory. The Players need to make the best choices!  During the Spectacles, you will fight the duels of Gladiators. Just like a lanista of two thousand years ago, you will manage many duels and you will place bets and tampering to obtain money. Duel by duel, your Gladiators will grow and become stronger and more popular. Which Gym will be able to prevail and become the most glorious of the ancient world?  Familia Gladiatoria is the first in a series of games that aim to recreate the whole cruel and multiform world of Imperial Rome spectacles. The MUNERA series will allow you to live not only the training of Gladiators and their challenges, but also the hunts in the arena and the chariots in the Circus Maximus.","/boardgame/80869/munera-familia-gladiatoria"

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.  The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.  The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.   Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.","/boardgame/96/broadsides-and-boarding-parties"

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!  Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.  Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.  During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.  There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.  Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.  Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.","/boardgame/884/way-out-west"

To set up the game, each player takes his pizza cutter (a wooden stick) and the die and topping counters that match. Each player places two toppings on the game board in the spaces designated with an X.  In each round, the three players take turns placing one topping on the game board; that topping cannot be placed adjacent to any of that player's other toppings. Each player then secretly chooses a number (1-6) on his die; players reveal the numbers and lay their pizza cutters on the board in the space matching their number. The cutters divide the pizza into one of 216 possible outcomes, creating a number of slices. In each slice if a player has more toppings than each opponent, he replaces those opponent's toppings with his own; if two players tie for the most toppings, the toppings of the third player are removed but not replaced; in a three-way tie, nothing changes. (NB: If a player has at most one topping in each slice, then his toppings cannot be removed or replaced this round.)  Whoever first places his 16 toppings on the game board wins.  With only two players, the cutter and toppings of the third color are still used, with players taking turns placing those toppings on the board. If all 16 toppings of the third color are on the board before either player gets his toppings on the board, then both players lose.","/boardgame/99808/pizza-theory"

Every time you defeat a monster, you go up a level. The first player to level 10 wins.

The game doesn't have any new mechanics and should be easy to learn for anyone who's played one of the other Munchkin games. Hirelings are included and are called allies. There are four classes: Cop, Man, Soldier, and Warrior (which is identical to the class of the same name in fantasy Munchkin). This set also has powers; there are seven of them with two cards each, for a total of 14 cards. The mechanics of powers are exactly the same as in the other Munchkin sets that have them.  Several Santa monsters are included, as well as two new monster categories, Alien and Robot, which currently aren't recognized in any of the other Munchkin games.

There are 180 huge and thick playing pieces like those in Granada, 165 smaller marker pieces, two large hard-mounted game boards like that in Granada, and 64 cards.  The map stretches from Britain to Persia, North Africa to Norway. Europe is divided into areas, each of them rated for their resources, manpower potential, and defense value. Armies move along the routes that connect these areas, and the object of the game is to conquer and hold as much territory as you can. Soldier Emperor is very true to history but is easily playable by anyone with an interest in games or history.  This is probably the first time that Persia has appeared in a Napoleonic wargame, but the Persians fought the Russians twice in this period and also threatened war with the Turks. They receive two armies, plus their fine leader, Crown Prince Abbas Mirza.  Turkey's eastern border regions are shown as well: Kurdistan and Baghdad appear. Unlike other games, the Turkish player can't operate with a secure right flank but must worry about his or her &amp;quot;back door.&amp;quot; The Turks begin with rather mediocre leadership, Ebubekir and Bayrakdar on land and Seyit Ali on the sea. But once Sultan Selim is overthrown (an event brought about by card play), Turkish leadership improves as junior generals are promoted. The Turks also can deploy the Banner of the Prophet, using Mohammed's ancient flag to inspire their troops.  Austria has a large army, one good general for most of the game (Archduke Charles) and a slim chance to receive an excellent one (Radetzky) and another good one (Frimont) late in the game. The rest of the Austrian generalship is not so good, and the empire is surrounded by potential enemies.  Prussia is small and relatively weak, but does have two fair generals (Yorck and Bl&amp;uuml;cher) and a good army. But if the army is lost in action Prussia's low resources and manpower will make the losses difficult to replace.  France of course has Napoleon, some other very good generals, and the largest army in the game. The French player also has the Imperial Guard. France has a powerful economy and strong starting position &amp;ndash; and a large target painted right on the French player's back. France's revolutionary ways bring its player a number of game advantages (in movement and battle) and some disadvantages as well (in diplomacy, at least until France's enemies have been beaten into submission).  Britain has the expected advantages: large income from overseas trade, a powerful fleet, and Lord Nelson. They also have a couple of lesser admirals (Collingwood and Jervis) and the outstanding Duke of Wellington to lead the land forces. But the army is small, and hard to replace if lost.  Spain can call out guerrillas if invaded, and will need every advantage to offset its weak economy, poor generalship and second-rate army. The fleet is good, and Gravina is a good admiral. Spain also has access to several minor countries that others can't easily reach, and a starting position in Italy that can allow for quick expansion (Etruria, held by a Spanish prince in 1803).  Russia, the final player-controlled country, has a vast land area, a strong position on the edge of the board, and a large and strong army. Leadership is good, with Kutusov and Kamensky the best of the lot plus Senyavin to command the fleet. But as in Soldier Kings, the Russian player will be chronically short of cash and willing to do many things to change this.  As in Soldier Kings, the game can be played with fewer than seven players, all the way down to two. Card play drives the action, with players able to play cards at any time and thwart their opponents' plans. Play order is determined by each country's initiative, and generals and admirals move their forces from area to area. And like Soldier Kings, combat is simple to resolve but contains many wrinkles of strategy.  If you liked Soldier Kings, you'll adore Soldier Emperor. Play is fast and furious, strategies are many, and the excitement level is high. A game lasts about four hours, with the campaign game taking somewhat longer.","/boardgame/7861/soldier-emperor"

The catch? They don't know the island is the final home of dinosaurs, survivors of millions of years, and they aren't happy to let outsiders explore their island. Of course, the pirates also don't know that the island is sinking or that there are other pirates looking for the same treasure. Who will get away with the most loot and become the pirate remembered by history?  Before the game, players outfit themselves with a variety of crew, weapons, and gear before choosing the section of the island that they will explore, knowing that the jungle takes longer than the beach as they look for their parts of the map. The search can be interrupted as other players play dinosaur (and other) cards to cause mayhem and carnage. Once the treasure is located, players draw treasures from a bag, looking to avoid the pirate ghost and island sinking events, and return safe to their ship &amp;ndash; a question of how far they'll go in pushing their luck.","/boardgame/73472/pirates-vs-dinosaurs"

The game is set up with a modular board, depicting resources, victory point locations and the players' town halls. Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.  Each turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.

What is the game, you ask? Each player has a hand of four task cards showing dice combinations and other tasks that the player is trying to achieve during a game round, such as a sum of pips less than 13, or two white dice and one black die; each card has a point value on it, with the tougher cards obviously being worth more points. Someone rolls a bunch of white, black and red dice, then players take turns choosing a die from the pool. Each player also holds one action card that lets him manipulate the dice to better achieve his tasks.  On a turn, a player either takes a die or passes from the round. Once everyone has passed, players assign dice to their task cards, with red dice counting as either black or white. Complete your tasks, and you'll cheer (and score points); have dice unused, and you'll wish that you'd never been born &amp;ndash; or you'll just lose a couple of points. Depends on how much of a drama queen you are.  After each round, a player refills his hand of cards in the appropriate proportions, and after each player has started a round 1-3 times (depending on the number of players), the game ends and players tally their points.","/boardgame/87893/take-it-or-leave-it"

The despicable evil marauders attack everywhere in search of conquest. The citizens are helpless and will soon be overwhelmed. Death and destruction awaits all those in the path of the evil ones.  In Dark Minions players represent those forces of evil as they try to pillage and destroy towns. Each turn, the players typically roll three dice and may use the resulting numbers to attack Towns to win Vanquish Points (VPs) &amp;ndash; the further along into the game, the more VPs the Towns are worth. Players also attempt to capture Towers in order to level up experience (which enables the player to roll better dice), to re-spawn dead minions from the graveyard, and to &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; the services of the various Overlords. In the end, it's all about VPs and the first player to 40 VPs in a four-player game wins.  The advanced game adds 15 Minion Overlords, each with a unique special power that may affect the play or the outcome of the game. They patiently wait to enter play and wreak their terrible havoc. Using their abilities wisely is one of the many keys to victory.  Dark Minions includes a small expansion called Demon Lords that adds more Overlords, a special town tile, and a special die &amp;ndash; making for many ways to mix up the game play!","/boardgame/97094/dark-minions"

A fun, easy to learn, but hard to master, game, with funny references to the real elements from the periodic table.  Gameplay: Players alternate rounds, during which they try to change the pieces on the board, in such a way that they can be the same shape represented by the cards in their hands. The cards represent new elements that the players discover, and when the board has the proper form, the player reveals from his hand the element he/she discovered and adds the card to his/her pile of earned points.  Game End: The game ends when a player can no longer draw more cards.  The winner is the player with the most points or, in case of a tie, the one that discovered more elements that are next to each other in the Periodic Table of the Elements (chairs not included).

The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points.

Typically the game is played in real time -- that is, the game is more likely to be played at school or at a game convention over a period of days or weeks than at a friends house in an afternoon.  There are many scenarios outlined in the game but the simplest is to give every player the name and picture (if necessary) of another player and a dart gun. If you successfully kill your target you take his target as your new target. You may not shoot at anyone who is not your target except in self defense. Obviously, there needs to be at least one moderator.  There are several other interesting scenarios as well as suggestions for far more elaborate and interesting weapons than dart guns. For example, there are sci-fi, mafia  and spy vs spy scenarios.","/boardgame/8307/killer"

There are four noble Houses, fighting for power and supremacy in a medieval city. They are named after the four Tarot suits: Pentacles, Chalices, Swords and Wands. Players will represent different paths for Fate, and will try to shape the destiny of those Houses to best suit their goals.  The game is played over 6 or 9 turns, and at every turn each player has the opportunity to hide one (and sometimes more) cards under the board in front of him (this is called &amp;quot;influencing&amp;quot; the Houses and it's like a hidden bet on the house, trying to get control over it) and to play cards for their effects (Major Arcana cannot be hidden but have stronger effects). Playing cards will impact, among other things, the ranking of the Houses in terms of prestige. To optimize point scoring, a good player will try to gain influence over &amp;quot;winning&amp;quot; houses without wasting too many cards for acheiving that, and/or to influence Houses in the lower positions with little effort. Experienced players will learn how to deceive their opponents about their real intentions.  Skill, bluffing, intuition and reading your opponent&amp;rsquo;s moves are all skills required to gain victory.  Arcanum is the first board game by the world acclaimed Tarot publisher Lo Scarabeo, and includes a complete tarot deck: a &amp;quot;family friendly&amp;quot; version of the Initiatory Tarot of the Golden Dawn featuring wondrous illustrations by the artist Patrizio Evangelisti.","/boardgame/99770/arcanum"

There are four types of card:      Magic Spell: This spell is auctioned off between the mages who were sent to this card. It is paid for in Energy, and it can be used to get more energy or victory points.     Orb: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of Energy.     Holy Site: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of victory points and a random Artifact card.     Monster: The monster card is auctioned off the mages who were sent to this card. The player that wins it, defeats the monster and gets an amount of Magical Energy and/or victory points. The players may also decide to skip the auction and cooperate to defeat the monster, which will yield less reward.     After the Adventures have been resolved, players may trade and play Artifacts (some Artifacts are only useful in pairs). Played Artifacts will give Magical Energy and/or victory points.

Such elements as surprise and shock of first combat, combined arms combat, Canal crossing, as well as artillery bombardment and support have been captured in a game system that is easily grasped and yet allows subtle strategic decisions on both sides.

The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.  Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.  On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:  a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley.  b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.  Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley. A new galley is then made available.  The winner is the player with most VP from galleys boarded.  (precis from the review by gschloesser)","/boardgame/840/corsairs"

With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.  Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four ""perimeter"" markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.  The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.

Once all the zombies have been placed, zombies still in position will steal body parts or treasure from opponents, and those set to dig will dig the row, column, or specific space of the graveyard they are assigned to.  If you are competing for spaces in the graveyard (which is the norm), players compare the combined brainpower of their digging zombies, and the higher value gets to the contents of the grave first.

The board consists of various fields and camps that are seperated by highways and train tracks.  Each player has two bases located at his end of the board the player's flag goes in one of these bases; a low ranking piece is usually placed in the other as a decoy.  The object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag. Players place their pieces face down on the fields on their side of the board. A third player is required to act as a referee to determine the outcome of fights (which occur when a piece moves into a field with an opposing piece).  Fights are resolved based on the rank of different pieces.  Pieces that are ranked high such as the General or Lieutenant General defeat pieces of lesser rank such as Engineers (Gong Ping) and Sergeants.  There are two special tiles - a mine which destroys anyone who attacks it (with the exception of a Engineer), the missile which can kill any unit and in the process destroys itself.  Camps remain vacant at the start of the game and remain vacant until a piece occupies them.  Pieces that remain within a bunker are protected from attack while those on fields are not.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the animal species.  Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.  Players will use six major animal classes &amp;ndash; mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect &amp;ndash; to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.  All of this leads to the end game &amp;ndash; the final descent of the ice age &amp;ndash; where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.  But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...  Dominant Species: The Card Game consists of ten rounds of competition, each round occurring on ten of the twelve different Biome cards. The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.  Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.  Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.  The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins. Play proceeds from Biome to Biome in like fashion until the game ends and a winner is determined.  Reimplements      Dominant Species","/boardgame/96260/dominant-species-card-game"

You can play an element card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker element with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star element is wild and can represent any element you need; a trash card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star or an action card.

Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword.

You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies.

Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins.

Each player is building skyscrapers along the prestigious Fifth Avenue, competing for the best location next to the most businesses.  During scoring actions and at the end of the game, players score points per skyscraper depending on the number of different types of businesses that are adjacent.       During their turn, players make take one of four actions: take 3 skyscrapers into their supply, place a business on an open lot, take a black bidding card and move a commissioner, or score a district. Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner&amp;rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.  Nothing further may be built there for the remainder of the game.  The game ends when either there are no more businesses in the supply, or two building stops have been declared.  A final scoring round occurs for each district without a building stop.  The player with the most victory points is the winner.  This game is #9 in the Alea big box series.","/boardgame/9342/fifth-avenue"

You start your turn by picking up one more square of ice next to some water already open; this square will turn out to have more fish, or a polar bear, or to be hard ice instead of water and have a fox on it -- or instead it may confer a special power such as melting an extra square of ice or pushing a row of ice squares one space.  Meanwhile the players' Inuit meeples approach from the edge of the board to hunt the fish and the other animals to score points and to build igloos for territorial reasons.  The game ends when there's no more ice to be melted (all the squares next to open water have an Inuk or an igloo on them), prompting a final scoring based on which players have control of the remaining islands.  Even in the &amp;quot;gamers' version&amp;quot; (Inuit cannot enter a square with an opposing igloo, scoring is a little different at the end) noted by the authors, the tiles you draw determine, to a large extent, your luck in the game.  But your cleverness in scrambling to make the best of opportunities keeps Iglu Iglu interesting.","/boardgame/9509/iglu-iglu"
